Unlike other companies who optimize for self-serve customer service (i.e., fix your own problems), we optimize for talking to as many of our users (you!) as possible.

## We're Here to Help

<Info>
Our team is committed to providing responsive, helpful support. We want to hear from you, whether you have questions, need assistance, or just want to provide feedback.
</Info>

## Contact Methods

### In-App Support

If you're already a customer but you're not on one of our plans that provides a direct Slack/MS Teams channel with us, you can easily reach support from within the incident.io application.

**To access in-app support:**

1. Open your organization selector
2. Look for the **"Contact support"** button
3. Submit your question or issue directly

Customers on plans with dedicated Slack or Microsoft Teams channels can reach us directly through those channels for even faster support.
