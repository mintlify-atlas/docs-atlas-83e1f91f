### [Audit Logs](/help-centre/account-admin/audit-logs)

Track all configuration changes and permission modifications within your incident.io account. Our audit log, powered by [WorkOS](https://workos.com/), provides:

- **Complete visibility** into configuration changes and user permission updates
- **Actor tracking** with location and user agent information
- **Structured data** with versioned schemas for reliable parsing
- **One-year retention** of audit entries
- **Export capabilities** to CSV or SIEM providers (Datadog, Splunk, Amazon S3)

Access audit logs from your [security settings](https://app.incident.io/settings/security) page (Owner or Admin role required).

## User Management

### [Active Participants vs Observers](/help-centre/account-admin/active-participants-vs-observers)

Understand the distinction between different user types during incidents:

**Active Participants:**
- Users classified as responders who actively manage incidents
- Anyone who posts messages in incident Slack channels
- Counted toward billing for incident response activities

**Observers:**
- Users who join incident channels to follow along
- Do not post messages or actively participate
- Stay updated without contributing to the incident response
