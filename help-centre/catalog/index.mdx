<Info>
The Catalog is your central source of truth for services, teams, and other organizational resources. Maintain clear ownership and enable better incident management through structured information.

## What is the Catalog?

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Services" icon="server">
    Services represent the applications, APIs, and infrastructure components your team operates:
    
    - **Clear ownership**: Assign teams responsible for each service
    - **Dependencies**: Map relationships between services
    - **Metadata**: Store repositories, documentation links, and runbooks
    - **On-call routing**: Connect services to on-call schedules
    
    Well-defined services enable faster incident response by clarifying who should be involved.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Teams" icon="users">
    Teams represent the groups of people who build and operate your services:
    
    - **Team structure**: Reflect your organizational hierarchy
    - **Service ownership**: Track which services each team owns
    - **On-call schedules**: Link teams to their on-call rotations
    - **Contact information**: Store Slack channels and email lists
    
    [Get started with teams →](/help-centre/catalog/getting-started-with-teams)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Custom Catalog Types" icon="shapes">
    Extend the catalog with custom types that match your needs:
    
    - **Infrastructure**: Data centers, regions, cloud providers
    - **Customers**: Track customer-specific information
    - **Environments**: Production, staging, development
    - **Anything else**: Define types that fit your workflow
    
    Custom types let you model your organization's unique structure.
  </Accordion>

## Building Your Catalog

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with teams">
    Define your team structure first. Teams are the foundation for service ownership and on-call rotations.
    
    [Getting started with teams →](/help-centre/catalog/getting-started-with-teams)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add core services">
    Identify your most critical services and add them to the catalog. Start with customer-facing services.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Assign ownership">
    Link each service to the team responsible for it. This enables automatic routing during incidents.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add metadata">
    Enrich services with links to repositories, documentation, dashboards, and runbooks.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Map dependencies">
    Document relationships between services to understand cascading failures.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set up integrations">
    Connect external tools to automatically sync catalog data and keep it current.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Catalog Integrations

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Service Catalog Sync" icon="cloud">
    Automatically import services from external platforms:
    
    - **PagerDuty**: Sync services and escalation policies
    - **Opsgenie**: Import teams and on-call schedules
    - **Backstage**: Connect to your developer portal
    - **Custom APIs**: Build your own integrations
    
    [Explore catalog integrations →](/help-centre/catalog/catalog-integrations/index)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Version Control Sync" icon="code-branch">
    Link services to their source code repositories:
    
    - Automatically attach repository links
    - Show recent commits during incidents
    - Identify code owners and contributors
    - Link to CI/CD pipelines
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Documentation Links" icon="book">
    Connect services to relevant documentation:
    
    - Runbooks for common issues
    - Architecture diagrams
    - API documentation
    - Deployment procedures
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Keeping Data Fresh

<Note>
Catalog data becomes stale quickly in fast-moving organizations. Regular maintenance is essential.

</CardGroup>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start Small, Grow Organically" icon="seedling">
    Don't try to catalog everything at once:
    
    1. Begin with critical customer-facing services
    2. Add supporting services as you encounter them in incidents
    3. Gradually expand to infrastructure and internal tools
    4. Let usage patterns guide what to add next
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Maintain Clear Ownership" icon="shield-check">
    Every catalog entry should have an owner:
    
    - Assign a team (not an individual) as the owner
    - Include backup contacts for redundancy
    - Link to on-call schedules for 24/7 services
    - Update ownership during org changes
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Rich Metadata" icon="tags">
    The more context you add, the more useful the catalog becomes:
    
    - Add all relevant links (repos, docs, dashboards)
    - Include description that explains what the service does
    - Tag services with environments, regions, or criticality
    - Note any special deployment or access requirements
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Leverage Integrations" icon="link">
    Reduce manual work with automated data sync:
    
    - Import services from PagerDuty or Opsgenie
    - Sync team rosters from HR systems
    - Pull repository metadata from GitHub/GitLab
    - Update on-call schedules automatically
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Warning>
Stale catalog data is worse than no data—it leads to incorrect escalations and wasted time during incidents. Keep your catalog current.
