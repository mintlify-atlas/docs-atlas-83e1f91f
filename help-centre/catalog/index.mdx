## Overview

The Catalog is your central source of truth for services, teams, and other resources in your organization. It powers intelligent routing, team-based filtering, ownership tracking, and integrations throughout incident.io.

## What is the Catalog?

The Catalog helps you organize and track:

- **Services** - Applications, APIs, databases, and infrastructure components
- **Teams** - Engineering teams and their members
- **Custom types** - Any other resources relevant to incidents (environments, regions, customers, etc.)

This information enriches incidents and enables powerful automation:

- Route alerts to the team that owns a service
- Filter incidents by your team
- Auto-populate incident fields based on affected services
- Track service reliability and incident patterns
- Link to service documentation and runbooks

## Getting Started with Teams

<Accordion title="Why use teams in incident.io?">
  Teams in incident.io help you:
  
  - **Filter by relevance** - Only see incidents and alerts for your team
  - **Automatic routing** - Route alerts to the right team's escalation path
  - **Ownership clarity** - Clear ownership of schedules, escalation paths, and services
  - **Simplified configuration** - Use team attributes in workflows and alert routes instead of creating separate configs for each team
  
  When you tell incident.io about your teams, the platform automatically:
  - Links escalation paths to teams in the catalog
  - Shows team-owned schedules at the top of lists
  - Filters incidents and alerts by your team membership
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Creating and managing teams">
  There are three ways to manage teams:
  
  **1. Manually in incident.io**
  - Best for small teams or getting started
  - Add/remove members from [Settings → Teams](https://app.incident.io/~/settings/teams)
  - Quick setup, no external dependencies
  
  **2. With SCIM or integrations**
  - Sync from identity providers (Okta, Google Workspace, Microsoft Entra ID)
  - Import from Backstage, Cortex, Linear, Opslevel, or Slack
  - Automatic sync when team membership changes
  - Set up via the three-step team setup wizard
  
  **3. Using catalog-importer or Terraform**
  - Manage teams as code
  - Define in your infrastructure repository
  - Version control and code review for changes
  - Sync relationships between teams, services, and other components

</Accordion>

## Catalog Types

### Services

Services represent the systems and components you operate:

- **Applications** - Web apps, mobile apps, background workers
- **Infrastructure** - Databases, message queues, load balancers
- **APIs** - Internal and external APIs
- **Third-party services** - External dependencies

**Key service attributes:**
- Owner team
- Service tier (critical, high, medium, low)
- Links to documentation, runbooks, dashboards
- On-call escalation path
- Dependencies and relationships

### Teams

Teams are groups of people who work together:

- Engineering teams (Backend, Frontend, Platform, etc.)
- Product teams
- Support teams
- Any organizational grouping relevant to incidents

**Team capabilities:**
- Member management
- Linked escalation paths and schedules
- Owned services and resources
- Team-specific Slack channels
- Custom attributes for routing

### Custom Types

Create custom catalog types for anything else:

- **Environments** - Production, staging, development
- **Regions** - Geographic locations
- **Customers** - For B2B multi-tenant systems
- **Features** - Product capabilities
- **Infrastructure** - Cloud accounts, clusters, etc.

## Importing and Syncing Data

<Note>
  **Keep your catalog up-to-date automatically**
  
  Instead of manually maintaining your catalog, sync it from existing sources:
  
  - **Service catalogs** - Backstage, OpsLevel, Cortex
  - **Identity providers** - SCIM (Okta, Google, Entra ID)
  - **Project management** - Linear, Jira
  - **Communication** - Slack user groups
  - **Code** - Terraform, catalog-importer
  
  This ensures your catalog always reflects reality and reduces maintenance burden.
</Note>

## Using the Catalog

### In Incidents

When declaring or updating an incident:

1. **Select affected services** - Choose from your catalog
2. **Auto-populate details** - Service attributes fill incident fields
3. **Invite relevant teams** - Workflows can auto-invite service owners
4. **Link to resources** - Quick access to runbooks and dashboards

### In Alert Routing

Use catalog data to route alerts intelligently:

```
IF alert.service.owner_team = "Payments"
THEN escalate to Payments Team escalation path
```

This works even if:
- Your alerts only include a service name
- The catalog links services to teams
- Teams are linked to escalation paths

No need to maintain routing rules for every service.

### In Workflows

Leverage catalog attributes in workflows:

- Send notifications to team-specific channels
- Invite the on-call person for the service's team
- Post to different status pages based on service tier
- Create Jira tickets in team-specific projects

### Team-Based Filtering

<Info>
  **See only what matters to you**
  
  By default, incident.io filters pages by your team membership:
  
  - **Incidents page** - Shows incidents affecting your team
  - **Alerts page** - Shows alerts for your team's services
  - **Schedules** - Your team's schedules appear first
  - **Escalation paths** - Your team's paths are prioritized
  
  Configure which field is used for filtering in [Settings → Teams → Configure](https://app.incident.io/~/settings/teams/configure).
</Info>

## Catalog Best Practices

<Accordion title="Service Organization">
  - **Right granularity** - Not too broad ("Backend") or too specific ("OrderService-Worker-3")
  - **Consistent naming** - Follow a naming convention
  - **Clear ownership** - Every service should have an owner team
  - **Service tiers** - Define criticality (critical, high, medium, low)
  - **Keep it current** - Archive deprecated services
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Team Structure">
  - **Align with reality** - Mirror your actual team structure
  - **Clear boundaries** - Teams should have distinct responsibilities
  - **Manageable size** - Not too large or too small
  - **Sync from source** - Use SCIM or integrations to avoid drift
  - **Regular reviews** - Update as teams change
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Attributes and Metadata">
  - **Add useful context** - Links to docs, dashboards, repos
  - **Use in automation** - Consider how attributes will be used in routing and workflows
  - **Avoid duplication** - Don't recreate data that exists elsewhere
  - **Keep it simple** - Start with basics, add complexity as needed
  - **Document meanings** - Ensure attributes are clearly understood
</Accordion>

## Advanced Features

### Relationships

Define relationships between catalog entries:

- **Service dependencies** - Which services depend on which
- **Team ownership** - Which teams own which services
- **Service hierarchies** - Parent-child service relationships
- **Component groupings** - Logical groupings of related items

Relationships enable:
- Impact analysis ("If this service fails, what else is affected?")
- Automatic routing ("Alert the team that owns the dependent service")
- Cascade notifications ("Notify teams of all affected services")

### Custom Attributes

Add custom attributes to any catalog type:

- **Text fields** - Free-form text
- **Links** - URLs to external resources
- **Single select** - Choose one option
- **Multi-select** - Choose multiple options
- **Catalogs** - Link to other catalog entries

Use custom attributes in conditions throughout incident.io.

### API and Automation

Manage your catalog programmatically:

- **REST API** - Create, update, delete catalog entries
- **Terraform provider** - Manage catalog as code
- **catalog-importer** - Sync from custom sources
- **Webhooks** - React to catalog changes

See the [API documentation](/api-reference) for details.

## Maintenance and Hygiene

### Re-syncing Data

If catalog data gets out of sync:

1. Go to the integration settings
2. Trigger a manual re-sync
3. Review and resolve any conflicts
4. Verify data is correct

See [How to re-sync Catalog data](/help-centre/catalog/how-to-re-sync-catalog-data).

### Regular Reviews

Schedule periodic catalog reviews:

- **Quarterly** - Review and update service ownership
- **After re-orgs** - Update team structures and memberships
- **When launching** - Add new services
- **When deprecating** - Archive old services

### Data Quality

Maintain high-quality catalog data:

- ✅ All services have owner teams
- ✅ Team membership is current
- ✅ Links and documentation are up-to-date
- ✅ Service tiers are accurate
- ✅ Deprecated services are archived
