<Info>
The Catalog is your source of truth for organizational structure, services, and resources. It powers intelligent alert routing, team organization, and incident context in incident.io.
</Info>

## Overview

The Catalog in incident.io is a flexible system for organizing your organization's structure, services, and resources. It's the foundation that enables:

- **Dynamic alert routing** to the right teams
- **Automatic escalation** based on service ownership
- **Team-based filtering** of incidents and alerts
- **Service context** in incidents
- **Organizational relationships** between teams, services, and infrastructure

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Catalog Types

The Catalog organizes information into types:

**Built-in types:**
- **Teams**: Groups of people who own services and respond to incidents
- **Users**: Individuals in your organization
- **Escalation Paths**: How to reach teams when issues occur
- **Schedules**: Who's on-call and when

**Custom types:**
- **Services**: Applications, APIs, databases, infrastructure components
- **Features**: Product capabilities that span multiple services
- **Domains**: Business domains or product areas
- **Environments**: Production, staging, development
- **Regions**: Geographic locations
- **Customers**: For tracking customer-specific infrastructure
- **Anything else**: Model your organization your way

<Note>
You have complete flexibility to create custom types that match your organization's structure. Don't feel constrained by common patterns - model what makes sense for you.
</Note>

### Relationships

Connect catalog entries to enable intelligent routing:

<Accordion title="Service → Team">
**Relationship**: Services are owned by teams

**Use case**: Route alerts about a service to the team that owns it

**Example**: 
- `payments-api` service owned by `Payments Team`
- Alert tagged with `service=payments-api`
- Automatically route to Payments Team's escalation path
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Team → Escalation Path">
**Relationship**: Teams have associated escalation paths

**Use case**: Know how to page a team when needed

**Example**:
- `Payments Team` linked to `payments-escalation` path
- Incident affects Payments Team
- Automatically escalate using payments-escalation configuration
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Service → Service">
**Relationship**: Services depend on other services

**Use case**: Understand cascading failures and dependencies

**Example**:
- `checkout-service` depends on `payments-api`
- Alert for payments-api
- Know that checkout might also be affected
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Custom Relationships">
Create any relationships that make sense:
- Features → Services (which services power a feature)
- Services → Environments (service instances per environment)
- Teams → Domains (which domains teams own)
- Customers → Services (customer-specific infrastructure)
</Accordion>

  <Step title="Navigate to Catalog settings">
    Go to Settings → Catalog
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create new type">
    Click "Create type" and name it (e.g., "Services")
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define attributes">
    Add fields like name, description, owner, status, etc.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure relationships">
    Define how this type relates to others
  </Step>
  <Step title="Import or create entries">
    Add actual services or sync from external source
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Catalog Attributes

Attributes provide additional information about catalog entries:

**Common attribute types:**

## Using Catalog for Routing

### Dynamic Alert Routing

Use Catalog relationships to route alerts automatically:

**Traditional approach (doesn't scale):**
- Create alert route for Team A
- Create alert route for Team B  
- Create alert route for Team C
- Result: Dozens of alert routes to maintain

**Catalog-powered approach (scales):**
1. Tag alerts with `service` attribute
2. Catalog links service → team → escalation path
3. Single alert route uses expression: `alert.attributes.service.owner.escalation_path`
4. Result: One route that works for all teams

<Note>
**Key insight**: Don't create configurations per team. Instead, use Catalog relationships to dynamically route to the right team based on context.
</Note>

### Example Routing Scenarios

<Accordion title="Route by Service Owner">
**Setup:**
- Services in Catalog with `owner` relationship to Teams
- Teams linked to Escalation Paths
- Alerts tagged with `service` attribute

**Expression:**
```
alert.attributes.service.owner.escalation_path
```

**Flow:**
1. Alert tagged: `service=checkout-api`
2. Catalog lookup: `checkout-api` owned by `Payments Team`
3. Catalog lookup: `Payments Team` has `payments-escalation` path
4. Route to: `payments-escalation`
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Route by Feature">
**Setup:**
- Features in Catalog with `primary_team` relationship
- Incident form asks "Which feature is affected?"

**Workflow expression:**
```
incident.affected_feature.primary_team.escalation_path
```

**Flow:**
1. Incident declares: feature=checkout
2. Catalog: checkout feature owned by Payments Team
3. Escalate to: Payments Team's escalation path
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Route with Fallback">
**Expression:**
```
alert.attributes.service.owner.escalation_path ?? escalation_paths.default
```

**Flow:**
1. Try to find service owner's escalation path
2. If not found, use default escalation path
3. Ensures alerts always get routed somewhere
</Accordion>

## Team-Based Filtering

### Automatic Filtering

By default, dashboards filter to show only relevant items:

**For team members:**
- **Incidents**: Only incidents affecting your team(s)
- **Alerts**: Only alerts for services your team owns
- **Escalation paths**: Your team's paths shown first
- **Schedules**: Your team's schedules highlighted

**Configuration:**
- Set which custom field determines "affected teams"
- Set which alert attribute determines "owning team"
- Users can override filters to see everything

[Configure team filtering →](/help-centre/catalog/getting-started-with-teams)

### User Preferences

Individual users can control their default view:

- Filter by my teams (default)
- Filter by specific teams
- Show everything (no filtering)
- Remember per-page preferences

Access via Preferences → My Dashboard

## Catalog Maintenance

### Keeping Catalog Updated

<Accordion title="Automated Sync (Recommended)">
Use integrations to keep Catalog fresh:
- SCIM for teams and users
- catalog-importer for services
- Terraform for infrastructure-as-code
- API for custom automation

**Benefits:**
- Always up to date
- No manual work
- Reduces errors
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Re-syncing Data">
Manually trigger re-sync when needed:
- After major organizational changes
- When external system data changes
- To refresh stale data

[How to re-sync Catalog data →](/help-centre/catalog/how-to-re-sync-catalog-data)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Audit and Cleanup">
Regularly review Catalog:
- Remove deprecated services
- Update ownership changes
- Verify relationships are correct
- Archive old teams or services

**Tip**: Use Catalog insights to find entries without owners or with broken relationships.
</Accordion>

### Data Quality

<Warning>
**Garbage in, garbage out**: Alert routing is only as good as your Catalog data. Invest time in keeping it accurate.
</Warning>

Best practices:
1. **Assign owners**: Every service should have an owning team
2. **Link escalation paths**: Every team should have an escalation path
3. **Regular reviews**: Monthly audit of Catalog accuracy
4. **Onboarding process**: New services must be added to Catalog
5. **Offboarding process**: Remove deprecated services

## Advanced Catalog Usage

### Catalog in Workflows

Use Catalog data in automated workflows:

- **Notify service owner**: Send Slack message to service owner when incident affects their service
- **Create tickets**: Auto-create Jira issue in team's project
- **Update channels**: Post to team-specific Slack channel
- **Assign roles**: Auto-assign Incident Lead from on-call for affected team

### Catalog in Forms

Incident forms can reference Catalog:

- **Affected Services**: Dropdown of all services
- **Affected Teams**: Multi-select of teams
- **Feature Selection**: Choose from Catalog features
- **Customer Impact**: Link to customer entries

Catalog relationships then enable automatic actions based on selections.

### Catalog in Insights

Analyze incidents using Catalog dimensions:

- Incidents per team
- MTTR by service tier
- Alert volume per service
- Coverage gaps (services without owners)

## Best Practices

<Note>
**Start simple**: Begin with just Teams and Services. Add more types as you identify needs. Don't over-engineer upfront.
</Note>

### Structuring Your Catalog

1. **Start with ownership**: Focus on getting team ownership of services right first
2. **Add incrementally**: Don't try to model everything at once
3. **Follow your org**: Match your actual organizational structure
4. **Keep it current**: Automate sync where possible
5. **Document relationships**: Clear rules for what owns what

### Naming Conventions

- **Consistent casing**: Choose snake_case, kebab-case, or PascalCase
- **Clear, descriptive names**: "Payments API" not "PAPI"
- **Avoid abbreviations**: Unless universally known in your org
- **User-facing perspective**: Name as users would understand

### Organizational Buy-In

- **Make teams owners**: Teams should maintain their own service entries
- **Show value early**: Start with alert routing to demonstrate benefits
- **Provide visibility**: Dashboards showing who owns what
- **Integrate with existing**: Sync from existing service catalogs
