## What's incident.io?

Fair question!

We're a **modern incident management platform**. We help high-growth companies like yours declare, collaborate, communicate around and learn from events that disturb their normal course of business - from critical infrastructure being down, to data breaches and security incidents.

We're already helping hundreds of [happy customers](https://incident.io/love) **like Etsy, Miro, Hashicorp, Skyscanner, and StubHub** reduce their downtime and answer questions like:

- "*I just got pulled into an incident: what's happening, and how bad is it?*"
- "*Do we have the right people in the room to help?*"
- "*Where's the post-mortem?*"
- "*How many incidents did we have this month? How long did it take us to solve?*"

We hope you'll be one of them!
