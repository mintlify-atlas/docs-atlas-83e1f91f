## Key Features for Incident Response

### Decision Flows

<Accordion title="What are Decision Flows?">
  Decision Flows help you make important decisions during an incident by guiding responders through a set of steps. They're particularly useful for situations like:
  
  - Determining whether to update your public status page
  - Deciding if something needs regulatory reporting
  - Assessing customer impact and communication needs
  
  You can create Decision Flows from [Settings → Decision Flows](https://app.incident.io/settings/decision-flows), either from scratch or using pre-built templates like the Data Breach (GDPR) template.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="How do Decision Flows work?">
  Each Decision Flow consists of branches with:
  
  - **Node** - Displayed in the UI to help navigate the process
  - **Prompt** - Shown to the user with context (supports Slack mrkdwn)
  - **Options** - Choices the decision maker can select from
  
  Trigger Decision Flows automatically using Workflows based on conditions like incident severity or type.
</Accordion>

### Quick Actions

<Note>
  **Jump-start your incident response**
  
  Quick Actions help you get your incident response off the ground quickly by providing one-click access to common first steps:
  
  - Assigning key roles (e.g., "Make me Comms Lead")
  - Escalating to an expert
  - Joining an incident call
  - Linking to important documentation
  
  Configure Quick Actions in [Settings → Slack Channel](https://app.incident.io/settings/slack-channel) and use conditions to show them only when relevant.
</Note>

**Types of Quick Actions:**

- **Pre-Defined Actions** - Built-in actions from incident.io's library
- **Custom Link Actions** - Create links to internal documents or tools

You can add conditions to control when Quick Actions appear. For example, show a "Make me Comms Lead" action only for Critical incidents.

### Merging Incidents

When multiple incidents are declared for the same underlying issue, you can merge them together to:

- Consolidate communication in a single channel
- Maintain a unified timeline
- Avoid duplicated effort
- Keep all relevant information in one place

## Incident Lifecycle

<Steps>
  <Step title="Declaration">
    Start an incident through Slack, the dashboard, API, or automatically via alerts. Fill out the declare form with initial information like severity and summary.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Response">
    Assign roles, invite responders, create actions, and coordinate the response. Use Quick Actions to streamline common tasks.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Communication">
    Share updates with stakeholders, update status pages, and keep everyone informed. Use Decision Flows to guide important communication decisions.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Resolution">
    Mark the incident as resolved when the immediate issue is fixed. Complete the resolve form with final details.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Post-incident">
    Create follow-ups, generate timelines, write post-mortems, and conduct debriefs to learn from the incident.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Working with Incidents

### Incident Channels

Each incident gets a dedicated Slack channel where:

- All incident-related communication happens
- Responders can be easily @mentioned
- Timeline events are automatically captured
- Quick Actions and commands are available

### Incident Roles

Assign roles to clarify responsibilities during an incident:

- **Incident Lead** - Coordinates the overall response
- **Comms Lead** - Handles internal and external communications
- Custom roles specific to your organization

### Actions and Tasks

During an incident, create two types of actions:

  <Card title="Actions (Do Now)" icon="bolt">
    Tasks that need immediate attention during the incident, like rebooting a server or contacting a customer
  </Card>
  <Card title="Follow-ups (Do Later)" icon="fast-forward">
    Items to address after the incident, like improving test coverage or updating documentation
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Best Practices

<Info>
  **Pro Tips for Effective Incident Management**
  
  1. **Start fast, refine later** - Don't spend too much time on forms when declaring. Get the response started and add details as you learn more.
  
  2. **Use roles effectively** - Assign an Incident Lead early to coordinate, and a Comms Lead for any incident requiring stakeholder updates.
  
  3. **Leverage automation** - Set up workflows to automatically invite the right people, send notifications, and trigger Decision Flows.
  
  4. **Pin important messages** - Use the pin emoji to add key messages to your incident timeline for easy reference later.
  
  5. **Keep your team in the loop** - Post regular updates, even if just to say "still investigating" - silence creates uncertainty.
