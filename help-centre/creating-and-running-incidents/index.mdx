Effective incident management starts with quickly declaring incidents and coordinating your response team. This guide covers everything from creating your first incident to resolving it successfully.
</Info>

## Overview

When something goes wrong, incident.io helps you respond quickly by providing structured workflows, automated coordination, and clear communication channels. Whether you're responding to a production outage or a security incident, the platform guides you through each stage.

## Quick Start

<CardGroup cols={3}>

## Declaring Incidents

### Multiple Ways to Start

Incident.io offers flexibility in how you declare incidents:

<Accordion title="1. From Slack with /incident (or /inc)">
The fastest way to declare an incident. From any Slack channel:
- Type `/inc` or `/incident` and hit Enter
- Fill out the incident form (or skip and fill it later)
- incident.io creates a dedicated channel and notifies your team

**Pro tip**: Type `/inc Website is down` to pre-fill the incident summary.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="2. Turn a Slack message into an incident">
Saw something concerning in a channel? 
- Click the three dots on any Slack message
- Select "Create an incident"
- The message content becomes part of your incident context

This ensures important context isn't lost when escalating to an incident.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="3. From Microsoft Teams">
For Teams users:
- Navigate to the General channel in the Incidents Team
- Click the incident.io tab
- Fill out the declare form
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="4. Use inc.new in your browser">
Declare incidents from anywhere:
- Visit [inc.new](https://inc.new)
- Create a live or retrospective incident
- Fill out incident details

Great for creating retrospective incidents or when you're not in Slack/Teams.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="5. Automatically from alerts">
Alerts from your monitoring tools can automatically create incidents:
- Configure alert sources (Datadog, PagerDuty, Prometheus, etc.)
- Set up alert routes to determine which alerts create incidents
- Incidents are created with relevant context from the alert

[Learn more about alert configuration →](/help-centre/alerts/index)
</Accordion>

<Note>
**Tip**: In the heat of the moment, you don't need to fill out the entire form. By default, we'll create a low-severity incident with a randomly generated name. You can easily update these details later with `/inc rename` and `/inc update`.
</Note>

## Incident Lifecycle

### Understanding Incident Stages

<Steps>
  <Step title="Triage">
    Initial assessment phase. Determine if this is truly an incident and what severity it should be.
    - Quick decision-making
    - Can be declined if not a real incident
    - Minimal required fields
  </Step>
  <Step title="Active Response">
    The incident is confirmed and being actively worked on.
    - Dedicated Slack channel created
    - Roles assigned (Incident Lead, Comms Lead, etc.)
    - Regular status updates
    - Responders collaborate on resolution
  </Step>
  <Step title="Resolution">
    The immediate issue is resolved and services are restored.
    - Mark incident as resolved
    - Document resolution steps
    - Schedule debrief if needed
  </Step>
  <Step title="Post-Incident">
    Learning and improvement phase.
    - Review timeline
    - Create follow-up actions
    - Write post-mortem
    - Share learnings
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Quick Actions

Speed up your incident response with [Quick Actions](/help-centre/creating-and-running-incidents/quick-actions):

- Pre-configured actions for common scenarios
- One-click incident updates
- Automated status page updates
- Custom quick actions for your workflows

### Decision Flows

[Decision Flows](/help-centre/creating-and-running-incidents/decision-flows) help guide responders through complex decisions:

- Present multiple choice questions during incidents
- Trigger different workflows based on answers
- Ensure consistent decision-making
- Document decisions in incident timeline

## Advanced Features

### Incident Types

Customize forms and workflows for different types of incidents:

- Security incidents with specific fields and processes
- Infrastructure incidents with automated runbooks

Each type can have its own configuration, severity scales, and workflows.

### Incident Modes

<Accordion title="Live Incidents">
Real-time incidents happening right now. Full incident response activated with channels, notifications, and coordination.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Triage Mode">
Potential incidents being assessed. Lightweight process to determine if full incident response is needed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Test Incidents">
Practice incidents for training and testing. Won't affect production metrics or alerts.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Retrospective Incidents">
Document past incidents that weren't tracked in incident.io at the time. Useful for historical analysis and learning.
</Accordion>

### Merging Incidents

Sometimes multiple incidents turn out to be related to the same root cause:

- [Merge incidents](/help-centre/creating-and-running-incidents/merging-incidents) to combine their channels and context
- Preserve all timeline events and actions
- Maintain historical record of both incidents

## Communication

### Announcements

When an incident is declared, incident.io announces it to your team:

- Default announcements channel (`#incidents`)
- Severity-specific channels for critical incidents
- Custom announcement rules based on incident attributes
- Microsoft Teams or Slack notifications

### Status Updates

Keep everyone informed throughout the incident:

- Regular updates via `/inc update`
- Automated updates to status pages
- Stakeholder subscriptions
- Timeline of all updates

### Roles and Responsibilities

Clearly define who's doing what:

- **Incident Lead**: Overall coordination and decision-making
- **Comms Lead**: Internal and external communications
- **Technical Lead**: Technical investigation and fixes
- Custom roles specific to your organization

## Integration with Other Tools

### During Incidents

- **Video calls**: Automatic Zoom/Google Meet/Teams links
- **Status pages**: Update public and internal status pages
- **Ticketing**: Create Jira issues for tracking
- **Monitoring**: Pull in alerts and metrics

### Context Gathering

Incident.io automatically collects context:

- Pinned Slack messages
- Related alerts and metrics
- GitHub commits and PRs
- Sentry errors
- Image attachments

## Best Practices

<Warning>
**Don't wait to declare**. If you're not sure if something is an incident, declare it in triage mode. You can always decline it if it turns out not to be an incident. It's better to have the coordination space ready than to delay response.
</Warning>

<Note>
**Update early and often**. Regular status updates (every 15-30 minutes for major incidents) keep stakeholders informed and reduce interruptions to responders.
</Note>

### Incident Response Tips

1. **Declare early**: Don't wait for confirmation - start in triage mode
2. **Assign roles quickly**: Clear ownership accelerates response
3. **Update regularly**: Keep stakeholders informed to reduce noise
4. **Document as you go**: Pin important messages and decisions
5. **Focus on resolution first**: Post-mortem can wait until after resolution
