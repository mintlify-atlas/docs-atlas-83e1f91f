<Info>
incident.io's On-call system integrates alerts, schedules, and escalation paths to ensure the right people respond to issues 24/7. Powered by Catalog, it provides intelligent routing and team-based organization.
</Info>

## Overview

On-call management in incident.io consists of three core components working together:

1. **Alerts**: Configure alerts from your observability and monitoring tools
2. **Schedules**: Define who is on-call and when
3. **Escalation Paths**: Route alerts to the appropriate people and teams

Once configured, incident.io automatically pages the right people so they can acknowledge alerts and resolve issues quickly.

## Core Concepts

### Catalog-Powered On-Call

On-call in incident.io is built on the Catalog, your source of truth for teams, services, and organizational structure:

- **Teams** own services and have associated escalation paths
- **Services** can be linked to the teams that maintain them
- **Dynamic routing** uses Catalog relationships to page the right people
- **Flexible structure** allows using Teams, Services, or custom types

<Note>
You can structure your On-call around Teams, Services, or any custom Catalog type. This flexibility lets you match your organization's specific structure.
</Note>

### The On-Call Flow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Alert Received">
    An alert comes in from your monitoring tool (Datadog, Prometheus, CloudWatch, etc.)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Alert Routed">
    Alert routes determine which escalation path to use based on alert attributes
  </Step>
  <Step title="Escalation Begins">
    The escalation path determines who to notify first, how to notify them, and when to escalate
  </Step>
  <Step title="Response & Resolution">
    On-call responders acknowledge the alert and work to resolve the issue
  </Step>
  <Step title="Incident Creation (Optional)">
    If configured, alerts can automatically create incidents for coordination
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Setting Up On-Call

### 1. Configure Your Teams

Start by setting up teams in the Catalog:

<Accordion title="Import from existing systems">
- **Identity providers**: Sync from Okta, Google Workspace, Microsoft Entra ID using SCIM
- **Developer portals**: Import from Backstage, Cortex, Opslevel
- **Communication tools**: Sync from Slack or Microsoft Teams
- **Project management**: Import from Linear

[Learn more about team setup →](/help-centre/catalog/getting-started-with-teams)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Manage manually">
For smaller teams or getting started:
- Create teams directly in incident.io
- Add and remove members as needed
- Link teams to schedules and escalation paths

Go to [Settings → Teams](https://app.incident.io/~/settings/teams) to get started.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use Terraform or catalog-importer">
Manage teams as code:
- Define teams in Terraform configurations
- Use catalog-importer to sync from your existing data sources
- Maintain relationships between teams, services, and infrastructure

[Terraform provider documentation →](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/incident-io/incident/latest)
</Accordion>

### 2. Build Schedules

Schedules define when individuals are on-call:

**Key Features:**
- **Flexible handovers**: Daily, weekly, or custom rotation periods
- **Active hours**: 24/7 coverage or business hours only
- **Multiple layers**: Primary, secondary, and follow-the-sun rotations
- **Shadowing**: Onboard new responders safely
- **Calendar sync**: Export to Google Calendar, Outlook, or other calendar apps
- **Slack user groups**: Automatically sync on-call to Slack user groups

  </Card>
  <Card title="Import existing schedules" icon="file-import">

  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### 3. Configure Escalation Paths

Escalation paths define the notification strategy:

**Configuration Options:**
- **Multi-level escalation**: Start with on-call person, escalate to manager, then team
- **Notification timing**: How long to wait before moving to the next level
- **Repeat options**: How many times to retry if unacknowledged
- **Working hours**: Different escalation during business hours vs. nights/weekends
- **Round-robin**: Distribute alerts across multiple responders
- **Priority-based**: Different escalation paths for different alert priorities

<Warning>
**Best Practice**: Link escalation paths to teams in the Catalog. This enables dynamic routing where alerts are automatically sent to the right team based on the affected service.
</Warning>

### 4. Connect Alert Sources

Bring in alerts from your monitoring and observability tools:

**Supported Integrations:**
- Datadog, PagerDuty, Prometheus, Grafana
- CloudWatch, Azure Monitor, Google Cloud Monitoring
- Sentry, New Relic, AppDynamics
- Custom webhooks via HTTP endpoint

**Configuration Steps:**
1. Choose your alert source in [Alert Configuration](https://app.incident.io/~/alerts/configuration)
2. Follow setup instructions to connect
3. Send a test alert to verify connection
4. Configure alert attributes and priorities
5. Map alert fields to incident.io attributes

[Alert configuration guide →](/help-centre/alerts/index)

### 5. Set Up Alert Routes

Alert routes determine what happens with incoming alerts:

**Key Capabilities:**
- **Filtering**: Only process relevant alerts
- **Dynamic escalation**: Route to different teams based on alert attributes
- **Grouping**: Combine similar alerts to reduce noise
- **Incident creation**: Automatically create incidents from critical alerts
- **Priority mapping**: Map alert severity to escalation priority

<Accordion title="Dynamic Routing (Recommended)">
Instead of creating a route for each team:
- Tag alerts with Team or Service attributes
- Use Catalog relationships to find the right escalation path
- Route automatically based on which service is affected

Example: Alert tagged with `service=payments` → Catalog links payments service to Payments Team → Escalate to Payments Team's escalation path
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Static Routing">
For simpler setups:
- Route specific alert types to specific escalation paths
- Useful for centralized teams or when you have few teams
</Accordion>

### Notification Methods

- **Push notifications**: Mobile app notifications
- **SMS**: Text message alerts
- **Phone calls**: Voice calls for critical alerts
- **Slack/Teams**: Direct messages with alert details
- **Email**: Email notifications for lower priority

<Note>
Responders automatically receive prompts to configure their notification preferences when added to a schedule or escalation path.
</Note>

## Advanced Features

### Live Call Routing

[Live call routing](/help-centre/on-call/live-call-routing) enables phone-based escalation:
- Dedicated phone numbers for each escalation path
- Automatic routing to on-call responders
- Conference call bridging
- Voicemail for missed calls

### Priorities and Urgency

Different alert priorities can trigger different behaviors:
- **P1 (Critical)**: Immediate phone call, aggressive escalation
- **P2 (High)**: Push notification, standard escalation
- **P3 (Medium)**: Slack message, business hours only
- **P4 (Low)**: Email, no escalation

## Best Practices

<Note>
**Start with teams**: Set up your team structure first. This enables dynamic routing and makes your On-call configuration scale as you grow.
</Note>

<Warning>
**Don't create a route per team**: Instead, use dynamic routing with Catalog. Tag your alerts with team or service information, and let incident.io automatically route to the right escalation path.
</Warning>

### Recommended Setup

1. **Define clear ownership**: Every service should have a team that owns it
2. **Use dynamic routing**: Leverage Catalog relationships for automatic routing
3. **Test your setup**: Send test alerts to verify escalation paths work
4. **Document runbooks**: Link runbooks to services in Catalog
5. **Monitor coverage**: Ensure schedules have no gaps
6. **Regular reviews**: Update escalation paths as teams change

### Alert Hygiene

- **Filter noise**: Only page for actionable alerts
- **Group related alerts**: Reduce alert fatigue with smart grouping
- **Set appropriate priorities**: Not everything needs to wake someone up
- **Regular cleanup**: Remove or adjust noisy alert sources
