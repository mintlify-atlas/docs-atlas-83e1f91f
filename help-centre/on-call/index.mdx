## Key Features

### Schedules

<Accordion title="Building Schedules">
  Create on-call schedules that match your team's needs:
  
  - **Flexible rotations** - Daily, weekly, or custom rotation patterns
  - **Multiple layers** - Combine primary, secondary, and backup layers
  - **Time zones** - Support for distributed teams across time zones
  - **Holiday support** - View and account for holidays in schedules
  - **Overrides** - Easily swap shifts or cover for teammates
  
  Learn more about [Building schedules](/help-centre/on-call/schedules/building-schedules).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Importing and Syncing Schedules">
  If you're migrating from another on-call tool:
  
  - Import schedules from PagerDuty, Opsgenie, and other providers
  - Duplicate existing schedules to create similar rotations
  - Sync schedules with Slack user groups automatically
  
  See [Importing and duplicating schedules](/help-centre/on-call/schedules/importing-and-duplicating-schedules) for details.
</Accordion>

### Escalation Paths

Escalation paths define who gets notified and in what order when an alert comes in. Configure multiple levels to ensure alerts are never missed:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Level 1 - Initial Notification">
    Alert the person currently on-call for the primary schedule
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Level 2 - Secondary Responder">
    If no response after a set time, escalate to a secondary schedule or specific individuals
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Level 3+ - Additional Escalation">
    Continue escalating through additional levels, teams, or managers as needed
  </Step>
</Steps>

Escalation paths can route to:
- People currently on-call for a schedule
- Everyone on a schedule
- Specific individuals
- A mix of all three

### Live Call Routing

<Note>
  **Get hold of on-call responders by phone**
  
  Live call routing provides a phone number that routes incoming calls to whoever is currently on-call. Perfect for:
  
  - Urgent support lines
  - Regulatory requirements
  - Customers who need immediate assistance
  - Situations where Slack might not be accessible
</Note>

**How it works:**

1. Request a phone number with your preferred country code and type
2. Configure who receives calls (on-call schedules, specific individuals, or both)
3. Calls route through multiple levels with 30-second timeouts
4. Optionally create incidents automatically from incoming calls

**Customization options:**
- Whitelist specific caller numbers
- Require key press to connect (e.g., "Press 1 to connect")
- Custom voice prompts
- Multiple language support

## Alert Management

### Receiving Alerts

When you're on-call, you'll receive alerts through:

- **Slack notifications** - Direct messages with alert details
- **SMS** - Text messages for critical alerts
- **Phone calls** - For the most urgent situations
- **Push notifications** - Mobile app notifications

<Info>
  **Setting up notifications properly**
  
  Configure your device settings to ensure on-call notifications break through:
  - Add incident.io to your Do Not Disturb bypass list
  - Enable critical alerts on iOS
  - Configure notification channels on Android
  - Add live call routing numbers to your contacts
  
  See [Setting up notifications on iOS and Android](/help-centre/on-call/being-on-call-as-a-responder/setting-up-notifications-on-ios-and-android) for step-by-step guides.
</Info>

### Acknowledging and Resolving

When you receive an alert:

1. **Acknowledge** - Let the system know you're looking at it
2. **Investigate** - Determine if action is needed
3. **Resolve** - Mark resolved when the issue is fixed
4. **Escalate** - Create an incident if the situation warrants it

## Best Practices

<Accordion title="Schedule Design">
  - **Keep rotations reasonable** - Avoid overly long on-call shifts that lead to burnout
  - **Build in backup layers** - Have secondary coverage in case primary responders are unavailable
  - **Respect time zones** - For distributed teams, consider follow-the-sun rotations
  - **Plan for holidays** - Ensure coverage during holiday periods with enough advance notice
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Escalation Strategy">
  - **Set appropriate timeouts** - Give responders enough time to acknowledge without too much delay
  - **Don't escalate too quickly** - 5-10 minutes is usually reasonable for the first level
  - **Have clear escalation paths** - Make sure everyone knows who to escalate to
  - **Test your setup** - Regularly verify that alerts reach the right people
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Alert Fatigue Prevention">
  - **Set up proper deduplication** - Avoid alerting multiple times for the same issue
  - **Use appropriate severities** - Not everything needs to page someone
  - **Review alert volume** - Regularly assess and tune your alerting rules
  - **Provide context** - Ensure alerts include enough information to triage effectively
