- Migrate subscribers automatically
- Transfer historical incident data
- Preserve custom domain
- Redirect from old status page

[Migration guide →](/help-centre/status-pages/public-status-pages/migrating-from-atlassian-statuspage)

### From Other Providers

- Configure components to match
- Set up redirects
- Announce migration to subscribers

[Import subscribers →](/help-centre/status-pages/faqs/how-do-i-import-subscribers-from-another-status-page-provider)

## Best Practices

<Note>
**Update early and often**: As soon as you know there's an issue, post an initial update. Regular updates (every 30 minutes for major incidents) keep users informed and reduce support volume.
</Note>

<Warning>
**Don't over-publish**: Not every incident needs to be on the status page. Focus on customer-impacting issues. Internal incidents should use internal status pages instead.
</Warning>

### Communication Tips

1. **Be transparent**: Explain what's happening in clear language
2. **Set expectations**: Provide estimated resolution times when possible
3. **Use templates**: Maintain consistent tone and format
4. **Update regularly**: Even if there's no new information
5. **Resolve clearly**: Explain what was fixed and what users should expect

### Component Strategy

1. **Customer perspective**: Name components as users know them
2. **Appropriate granularity**: Not too many, not too few
3. **Logical grouping**: Organize related components together
4. **Keep it simple**: Average status page has 10-15 components
