## Status Page Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Timely Updates" icon="clock">
    Post updates regularly during incidents, even if there's no new information. Silence creates anxiety.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Clear Language" icon="message">
    Use plain language that non-technical users can understand. Avoid jargon and internal terminology.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Accurate Severity" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    Match the displayed severity to actual customer impact. Overstating or understating damages credibility.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Proactive Communication" icon="megaphone">
    Post to the status page as soon as you're aware of an issue, even if you're still investigating.
  </Card>

</Note>

## Communication During Incidents

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial notification">
    Post an "Investigating" update as soon as you're aware of the issue. Include:
    - What's affected
    - When it started
    - What you're doing
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Regular updates">
    Update every 15-30 minutes during active incidents, even if it's just to confirm you're still working on it.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Identified cause">
    When you understand the root cause, share it (at an appropriate level of detail for your audience).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitoring">
    After implementing a fix, post a "Monitoring" update to confirm you're watching for any issues.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Resolution">
    Clearly mark the incident as "Resolved" and summarize what happened and what was done.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Post-mortem (optional)">
    For significant incidents, consider posting a link to a detailed post-mortem once it's complete.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Never post information to public status pages that could expose security vulnerabilities or sensitive internal details.
</Warning>
