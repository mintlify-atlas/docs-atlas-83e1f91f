## Types of Status Pages

### Public Status Pages

<Accordion title="Standard Public Pages">
  Your typical public-facing status page where you can display:
  
  - **Ongoing incidents** - Real-time updates on active issues
  - **Scheduled maintenance** - Planned maintenance windows
  - **Component status** - Health status of individual services and systems
  - **Uptime metrics** - Historical uptime data for components
  - **Incident history** - Past incidents and their timelines
  
  Public pages are perfect for transparent communication with your entire user base. They're hosted on your custom domain (e.g., status.yourcompany.com) and can be customized to match your brand.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Public Pages with Sub-Pages">
  Sub-pages provide more granular status views for different audiences:
  
  **Use cases for sub-pages:**
  - **Multiple products** - Separate pages for independent product offerings
  - **Regional separation** - Different pages for different geographic regions
  - **Customer segments** - Tailored views for different customer types
  - **Service tiers** - Different status for premium vs. standard services
  
  Each sub-page can show status for specific components relevant to that audience, reducing noise and improving relevance.

</Accordion>

### Customer Status Pages

<Note>
  **Dedicated pages for specific customers**
  
  Customer pages add authentication to status pages, providing:
  
  - **Private access** - Only specific customers can view their page
  - **Customer-specific incidents** - Show only issues affecting that customer
  - **Dedicated infrastructure** - If you run separate infra per customer
  - **High-value customer support** - Premium status page experience
  - **Centralized management** - Manage all customer pages from one place
  
  Perfect for B2B SaaS with dedicated customer infrastructure or multi-tenant systems where issues may only affect specific customers.
</Note>

### Internal Status Pages

<Info>
  **Keep your team informed**
  
  Internal status pages are designed for your organization's stakeholders:
  
  - **All internal incidents** - Not just customer-facing issues
  - **Detailed technical info** - More detail than public pages
  - **Team-specific views** - Filter by team or service
  - **Internal-only incidents** - Show incidents that shouldn't be public
  - **Integration with Slack** - Link to incident channels
  
  Accessible only by authenticated users from your organization via Slack or SAML SSO.
</Info>

## Integration with Incidents

<Info>
  **Automated status page updates**
  
  Connect your incidents to status pages automatically:
  
  - Create status page incidents when declaring incidents in incident.io
  - Map incident severities to status page impact levels
  - Use workflows to automatically update status pages
