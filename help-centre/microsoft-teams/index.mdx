## Overview

The incident.io Microsoft Teams integration brings powerful incident management capabilities directly into Teams. Create incident channels, manage responders, send notifications, and track incident progress without leaving your communication platform.

<Info>
incident.io requires a communication platform to function. Microsoft Teams is one of our supported platforms, alongside Slack.

## Understanding Permissions

incident.io requests three categories of permissions for Microsoft Teams:

### Global Permissions

These permissions provide app-only access to resources across your Microsoft tenant:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Organizational Branding (Read)">
    **Permission:** `OrganizationalBranding.Read.All`
    
    **Purpose:** Display your organization's name and logo in the incident.io dashboard
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="User Directory (Read)">
    **Permission:** `User.ReadBasic.All`
    
    **Purpose:** View all users in your tenant to add them to the incident.io Catalog
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="App Installation (User)">
    **Permission:** `TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteAndConsentSelfForUser.All`
    
    **Purpose:** Send direct chats and activity notifications when users are assigned roles or actions
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Chat Management">
    **Permissions:** `Chat.Create` and `TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteAndConsentSelfForChat.All`
    
    **Purpose:** Create group chats for private incidents and install the incident.io app into those chats
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Team-Specific Permissions

These permissions only apply to teams where the incident.io app is installed:

<Info>
**Scope:** These permissions do NOT grant access to other teams or chats in your Microsoft tenant—only to the teams where you explicitly install incident.io.

## Admin Consent Process

incident.io requires [Microsoft admin consent](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/enterprise-apps/user-admin-consent-overview#admin-consent) to function. This process must be completed by a Privileged Administrator.

### If You Cannot Consent

If you're not a Privileged Administrator:

1. You'll see a message indicating you cannot consent, or a dialog to request consent
2. Contact a Privileged Administrator in your organization
3. They should sign in to [Microsoft Entra](https://entra.microsoft.com/)
4. Navigate to **Applications → Enterprise Applications**
5. Search for "incident.io" and go to **Permissions** under the Security section
6. Click **"Grant admin consent for..."** to complete the flow

<Warning>
After consent is granted through Microsoft Entra, you must return to the incident.io app and go through the admin consent flow again so we can verify the permissions have been granted.
</Warning>

## Key Features

### Incident Channels

When you declare an incident, incident.io automatically creates a dedicated Teams channel where all incident communication happens:

- Channel names stay synchronized with incident names
- Channels can be automatically archived after incidents are resolved
- incident.io tabs provide quick access to incident details without leaving Teams

### Private Incidents

For sensitive incidents, incident.io can create private group chats instead of public channels:

- Control exactly who has access to incident details
- Add and remove members as needed
- All standard incident features work in private chats

[Using private incidents in Microsoft Teams](/help-centre/microsoft-teams/using-private-incidents-in-microsoft-teams)

### Notifications and Activity

Stay informed with intelligent notifications:

- Direct notifications when assigned to incident roles
- Action item assignments delivered as chats
- Activity feed updates for incident changes
- @mentions in incident channels trigger Teams notifications

### Declare Incidents from Multiple Teams

Once incident.io is installed in your "Incidents" team, you can also install it into other teams:

<Tip>
**Benefits of multi-team installation:**
- Declare incidents from any team using the incident.io tab
- Create announcement rules to send incident updates to specific teams
- Give teams visibility into incidents without cluttering the main Incidents team
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

### Sign-In Issues During Installation

If you encounter problems signing in during the Microsoft Teams installation:

[Debugging sign-in issues](/help-centre/microsoft-teams/debugging-sign-in-issues-during-microsoft-teams-installation)

### Common Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="App not appearing in Teams">
    **Solution:** Verify that the incident.io app has been approved in your organization's Teams app policies. Contact your Microsoft Teams administrator to check app permission policies.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Cannot create channels">
    **Solution:** Ensure admin consent has been properly granted and that team-specific permissions were accepted when installing the app to the Incidents team.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Notifications not being received">
    **Solution:** Check that the `TeamsAppInstallation.ReadWriteAndConsentSelfForUser.All` permission has been granted in the global permissions step.
  </Accordion>
