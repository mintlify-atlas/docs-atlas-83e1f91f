## Key Features

### Saved Views for Quick Access

Saved views let you bookmark specific filter combinations and quickly apply them whenever you need them. Available across incidents, alerts, escalations, follow-ups, and tasks pages, saved views help you navigate to the data you check regularly and share useful views with teammates.

<Info>
All saved views are visible to everyone in your organization, making it easy to share insights across teams.

### Custom Dashboards

Build custom dashboards tailored to your organization's needs. Combine multiple panels to visualize the metrics that matter most to your team, from incident volume trends to resolution times and responder workload.

### Workload Analytics

Understand how much time your team spends responding to incidents with our intelligent workload tracking. We automatically calculate time spent based on activity in incident channels, issue trackers, and calls, giving you accurate insights into team effort.

<Note>
Workload metrics intelligently account for overlapping work across incidents, ensuring accurate calculations even for incident managers juggling multiple incidents simultaneously.
</Note>

### Data Refresh Frequency

Insight data is refreshed approximately every three hours. This means recently created or updated incidents may not immediately appear in your analytics dashboards.
