## Key Configuration Options

### Forms and Fields

<Accordion title="Configuring Incident Forms">
  As responders progress through an incident, they encounter several forms designed to collect information. These forms ensure that:
  
  - Automations run correctly based on incident data
  - The wider team stays aligned on core facts
  - You can analyze patterns in incidents via insights
  
  You can configure:
  - **Declare form** - Shown when declaring a new incident
  - **Accept form** - Shown when accepting a triage incident
  - **Update form** - Shown when sharing an update
  - **Resolve form** - Shown when resolving an incident
  - **Escalate form** - Shown when manually escalating
  
  Access these settings via [Settings → Forms](https://app.incident.io/~/settings/forms).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Custom Fields and Attributes">
  Create custom fields to capture organization-specific information during incidents. You can:
  
  - Control which fields appear on each form
  - Set conditional requirements based on severity or incident type
  - Configure default values and templates
  - Add custom descriptions and help text
</Accordion>

### Infrastructure as Code

<Note>
  **Manage your account with Terraform**
  
  incident.io maintains an [official Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/incident-io/incident/latest) that allows you to manage account configuration through code, including:
  
  - Custom fields
  - Incident severities and statuses
  - Incident roles
  - Schedules and escalation paths
  
  This brings incident.io configuration into the same code review and approval cycle as your other infrastructure.
</Note>
