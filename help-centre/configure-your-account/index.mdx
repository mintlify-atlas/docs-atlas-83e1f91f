Configuring your incident.io account properly ensures smooth incident management, automated workflows, and seamless integrations with your existing tools.
</Info>

## Overview

Your incident.io account can be customized to fit your organization's unique incident management needs. From configuring incident forms to setting up automation workflows, these settings help ensure your team has the right information at the right time.

## Incident Configuration

### Forms and Fields

Control exactly what information your team needs to provide at each stage of an incident:

<Accordion title="Declare Form">
Shown when declaring a new incident. Configure which fields are required, set default values, and create incident-type-specific forms. For example, you can:
- Hide the summary field unless the incident is at least Major severity
- Set different default severities instead of always starting with the lowest
- Make incidents start in triage mode by default
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Accept Form">
Displayed when accepting a triage incident. Customize what information responders need to confirm before accepting an incident.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Update Form">
Shown when sharing an update. Configure which fields are required for keeping stakeholders informed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Resolve Form">
Displayed when resolving an incident. Ensure all necessary information is captured before closing.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Escalate Form">
Shown during manual escalation. Configure what context is needed when escalating to additional responders.
</Accordion>

<Note>
**Best Practice**: Only require what you absolutely must, and prefer requiring fields at incident close rather than at incident start. If you require 5 fields when opening an incident, responders will be forced to provide 5 values before they begin responding.
</Note>

## Integration & Automation

### Infrastructure as Code

Manage your incident.io configuration using [Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/incident-io/incident/latest):

- Custom fields and their options
- Incident severities, roles, and statuses
- On-call schedules and escalation paths
- Workflow configurations

This allows you to bring incident.io configuration into the same code review and approval cycle as your other infrastructure.

### External Integrations

## Post-Incident Process

### Post-Incident Flow

Define your post-incident process to ensure consistent follow-through:

- Automatic timeline generation from incident activity
- Follow-up task creation and assignment
- Post-mortem document generation
- Debrief scheduling

[Learn more about configuring your post-incident flow →](/help-centre/configure-your-account/define-your-post-incident-process-using-the-post-incident-flow)

<Accordion title="Follow-Up Policies">
Enforce that follow-ups are completed based on incident priority. Set up policies that:
- Require high-priority follow-ups to be completed within a specific timeframe
- Send automatic reminders to assignees
- Escalate overdue follow-ups to team leads

[Configure follow-up policies →](/help-centre/configure-your-account/enforcing-follow-ups-are-completed-based-on-priority-(policies))
</Accordion>
