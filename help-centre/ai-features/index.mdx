## Core AI Capabilities

### Suggested Summaries

During the heat of an incident, responders don't always have time to write detailed summaries or update stakeholders. Suggested summaries analyze incident data and channel activity to automatically generate concise, accurate summaries that capture:

- The nature of the problem
- Impact to users or systems
- Potential root causes
- Next steps being taken

<Tip>
Suggested summaries maintain a consistent format, making it easy for newcomers to quickly understand incident status and jump in to help.
</Tip>

### Suggested Follow-ups

When an incident is resolved, our AI reviews the incident channel conversation to identify follow-up actions that were discussed but not yet created. Suggestions are intelligently matched against existing actions and follow-ups to avoid duplicates.

This ensures important post-incident work doesn't fall through the cracks during the transition from response to recovery.

### Scribe: AI-Powered Call Transcription

Scribe is your friendly AI note-taker that automatically joins incident calls to provide:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Real-time Transcription">
    Scribe transcribes who said what during your incident calls, using video, audio, and streaming captions to accurately attribute statements to participants. Transcripts are accessible in the incident details page.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Continuous Summaries">
    As the call progresses, Scribe builds detailed summaries highlighting important information, decisions, and next steps. Summaries are posted to the incident channel and dashboard in real-time.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Current Topic Tracking">
    See at a glance what's being discussed on the call with current topic updates posted to both the incident channel and dashboard, helping teammates decide if they should join.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Key Moments">
    Scribe proactively identifies and posts critical moments from calls, including important decisions, agreements, and discoveries. Examples include status page updates, rollback triggers, or breakthrough findings.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Note>
Scribe is available for Pro and Enterprise customers and works with Zoom, Google Meet, and Microsoft Teams calls.

## Privacy and Data Usage

We take data privacy seriously. Here's what you should know:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Third-party Processing" icon="shield-check">
    Scribe uses Recall.ai for raw transcription. Temporary recordings are deleted when the last human leaves the call
  </Card>
  <Card title="Data Retention" icon="database">
    We only store call transcripts to power Scribe features. No audio or video files are retained
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Info>
For comprehensive information about how incident.io uses AI, including data handling and privacy practices, visit our [How do we use AI?](/help-centre/configure-your-account/how-do-we-use-ai) documentation.
</Info>

## Language Support

<Warning>
Scribe is currently designed to operate primarily in English. While it will attempt to process calls in other languages (using Google Meet and Zoom's transcription), we do not officially support languages other than English at this time.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

### Scribe Not Joining Calls

If Scribe isn't joining your calls:

1. Verify you've re-authenticated your call provider integration with the latest permissions
2. For Zoom, check that recording is allowed in your Zoom app settings
3. Ensure meeting captions are enabled (required for Zoom transcription)

### Missing Transcripts

For Zoom calls specifically, Scribe relies on meeting captions. If you're not seeing transcripts:

- Enable "Allow Closed Captioning for this meeting" in Host Caption Control Settings
- Verify that "Automated captions" is enabled in your [Zoom settings](https://zoom.us/profile/setting?tab=meeting)

If issues persist after trying these steps, reach out to incident.io support for assistance.
