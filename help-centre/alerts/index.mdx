## Alert Management

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Alert Routing" icon="route">
    Route alerts to the right teams based on:
    
    - **Service ownership**: Automatically notify the team that owns the affected service
    - **Alert severity**: Route critical alerts differently than warnings
    - **Time of day**: Different routing for business hours vs. off-hours
    - **Custom conditions**: Use flexible rules to match your needs
    
    Smart routing ensures alerts reach the people who can respond most effectively.

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Automatic Incident Creation" icon="wand-magic-sparkles">
    Automatically create incidents from alerts based on configurable rules:
    
    - **Severity thresholds**: Create incidents for P0 and P1 alerts only
    - **Service mapping**: Map alerts to catalog services automatically
    - **Field extraction**: Pull relevant data from alerts into incident fields
    - **Custom conditions**: Fine-grained control over when incidents are created
    
    Automation ensures no critical alert is missed while reducing manual work.

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Alert Deduplication" icon="layer-group">
    Prevent alert storms from overwhelming your team:
    
    - **Fingerprint-based grouping**: Group alerts with similar characteristics
    - **Time window deduplication**: Merge alerts that occur within a time window
    - **Custom deduplication keys**: Define how alerts should be grouped
    - **Smart merging**: Combine alert context while preserving important details
    
    Deduplication turns hundreds of alerts into actionable incidents.

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Alert Enrichment" icon="sparkles">
    Enhance alerts with additional context:
    
    - **Catalog lookups**: Add service and team information automatically
    - **Runbook links**: Attach relevant documentation to alerts
    - **Historical context**: Show similar past incidents
    - **Custom attributes**: Extract and display important alert metadata
    
    Rich context helps responders understand and resolve issues faster.

  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set up routing rules">
    Configure rules to route alerts to the appropriate teams and escalation paths.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enable deduplication">
    Configure deduplication keys to group related alerts and prevent noise.

## Common Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why is an alert missing an attribute?" icon="circle-question">
    Alerts may be missing attributes for several reasons:
    
    - The monitoring tool didn't include the field in the webhook payload
    - Field mapping isn't configured correctly
    - The attribute is optional and wasn't set
    
    [Learn how to troubleshoot missing attributes →](/help-centre/alerts/why-is-an-alert-missing-an-attribute)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Does incident.io support Heartbeat monitoring?" icon="heart-pulse">
    Heartbeat monitoring ensures your monitoring systems are functioning correctly.

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Tune Alert Sensitivity" icon="sliders">
    Work with your monitoring team to ensure alerts are meaningful and actionable. Too many false positives lead to alert fatigue.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Clear Alert Descriptions" icon="file-lines">
    Ensure alerts include clear descriptions, affected services, and suggested actions. Context is crucial during incidents.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Regular Review" icon="rotate">
    Periodically review alert patterns and adjust routing rules. Your infrastructure and team structure evolve over time.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Document Integrations" icon="book">
    Maintain documentation about which monitoring tools send which alerts, and how they're routed. This helps during troubleshooting.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
Over-aggressive deduplication can hide important information. Balance noise reduction with visibility into distinct issues.
</Warning>
