## Overview

Alerts are the first line of defense in incident management. incident.io's alert system connects to your monitoring tools, intelligently routes alerts to the right people, and can automatically create incidents when needed.

## Key Concepts

### Alert Sources

Connect incident.io to your monitoring and alerting tools:

  </Card>
  <Card title="PagerDuty" icon="pager">
    Import alerts from PagerDuty

</CardGroup>

See all available integrations in [Alert source integrations](/help-centre/alerts/alert-source-integrations/index).

### Alert Routing

<Accordion title="Creating Escalations and Incidents from Alerts">
  Configure rules to determine what happens when alerts come in:
  
  **Route to escalation path:**
  - Send alerts to on-call responders
  - Follow escalation levels if no one acknowledges
  - Page people via Slack, SMS, and phone
  
  **Create incidents automatically:**
  - Declare incidents for critical alerts
  - Set incident severity and type based on alert attributes
  - Pre-populate incident details from alert data
  - Invite relevant responders automatically
  
  **Send to Slack channels:**
  - Post alerts to monitoring channels for visibility
  - Different channels for different alert priorities
  - Keep teams informed without paging
  
  Learn more in [Creating escalations and incidents from alerts](/help-centre/alerts/alert-configuration/creating-escalations-and-incidents-from-alerts).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Dynamic Escalation Paths">
  Route alerts to different teams based on alert attributes:
  
  - Use alert labels to identify which team owns a service
  - Automatically escalate to the on-call person for that team
  - No need to create separate alert routes for each team
  
  Example: If your alert includes a `team=payments` label, route it to the Payments team's escalation path.
  
  See [Dynamically setting an escalation path](/help-centre/alerts/alert-configuration/dynamically-setting-an-escalation-path) and [Escalating to the right team from an alert](/help-centre/alerts/alert-configuration/escalating-to-the-right-team-from-an-alert).
</Accordion>

### Alert Attributes and Priorities

<Note>
  **Enrich your alerts with context**
  
  Alert attributes provide the context needed for effective routing and response:
  
  - **Priority** - High, medium, low urgency levels
  - **Service** - Which service or system is affected
  - **Environment** - Production, staging, development
  - **Team** - Which team should handle this
  - **Region** - Geographic location of the issue
  - Custom attributes specific to your needs
  
  These attributes can be used in routing rules, incident creation, and escalation decisions.
</Note>

Learn about [Attributes and Priorities](/help-centre/alerts/alert-configuration/attributes-and-priorities).

## Alert Lifecycle

<Steps>
  <Step title="Alert Created">
    An alert is sent from your monitoring tool to incident.io
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Deduplication">
    If a similar alert already exists, the new alert is grouped with it instead of creating a duplicate
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Routing">
    Alert routes are evaluated to determine where the alert should go - escalation path, Slack channel, or incident creation
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Notification">
    Responders are notified via their configured channels (Slack, SMS, phone)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Acknowledgment">
    A responder acknowledges the alert, stopping further escalation
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Resolution">
    The alert is resolved either automatically when the issue clears or manually by a responder
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Alert Configuration

### Setting Up Alert Routes

1. **Connect your alert sources** - Integrate your monitoring tools
2. **Configure attributes** - Define which alert fields map to incident.io attributes
3. **Create routing rules** - Set up conditions and actions for different alert types
4. **Test your setup** - Send test alerts to verify routing works correctly

### Alert Timeline

Every alert maintains a timeline showing:

- When the alert was created
- Who was notified at each escalation level
- Acknowledgments and responses
- Resolution and any related incidents

This provides full visibility into how an alert was handled. Learn more about [Alert timeline](/help-centre/alerts/alert-configuration/alert-timeline).

## Deduplication

<Accordion title="How Deduplication Works">
  Alert deduplication prevents alert fatigue by:
  
  - **Grouping similar alerts** - Multiple alerts about the same issue are grouped together
  - **Smart matching** - Uses alert attributes to determine similarity
  - **Configurable rules** - Define your own deduplication logic
  - **Update existing alerts** - New occurrences update the existing alert instead of creating duplicates
  
  For example, if your monitoring system sends an alert every minute about high CPU usage, deduplication ensures you only get notified once until it's resolved.
</Accordion>

See [Alert Deduplication](/help-centre/alerts/alert-deduplication/index) for configuration details.

## Private Alerts and Incidents

<Info>
  **Handle sensitive incidents with privacy**
  
  Some incidents need to be kept private, such as:
  - Security incidents
  - HR or personnel issues  
  - Sensitive customer situations
  - Regulatory or legal matters
  
  Configure alert routes to create private incidents that limit visibility to only those who need to know.
  
  Learn more in [Routing private alerts to escalate and create incidents](/help-centre/alerts/alert-configuration/creating-private-incidents-from-alerts).
</Info>

## Integration Examples

### Datadog Monitors

Route Datadog monitor alerts to incident.io:

- Map monitor tags to incident.io attributes
- Use priority levels from Datadog
- Auto-create incidents for critical monitors
- Include monitor graphs in alert details

See [Migrating Datadog monitors to incident.io](/help-centre/migrating-datadog-monitors-to-incident-io).

### Custom HTTP Alert Sources

Build custom integrations for any tool:

- Send alerts via webhook
- Include custom attributes and metadata
- Full control over alert formatting
- Support for any JSON payload

Learn about [Custom HTTP alert sources](/help-centre/custom-http-alert-sources).

### Grafana Integration

Connect Grafana alerts:

- Route based on Grafana labels
- Include dashboard links in alerts
- Map alert states to priorities
- Test alerts with proper configuration

See [Why isn't my Grafana test alert triggering multiple times?](/help-centre/why-isn-t-my-grafana-test-alert-triggering-multiple-times) for troubleshooting.

## Best Practices

<Accordion title="Routing Strategy">
  - **Use priorities wisely** - Not everything needs to page someone immediately
  - **Route to teams, not individuals** - Use team escalation paths for better coverage
  - **Include context** - Ensure alerts have enough information to triage effectively
  - **Test your routes** - Regularly verify alerts reach the right people
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Preventing Alert Fatigue">
  - **Set up deduplication** - Avoid multiple alerts for the same issue
  - **Use appropriate thresholds** - Fine-tune your monitoring to reduce noise
  - **Aggregate low-priority alerts** - Send summaries instead of individual alerts
  - **Regular reviews** - Periodically assess and improve your alerting rules
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Incident Creation">
  - **Automate critical alerts** - Create incidents automatically for high-priority issues
  - **Pre-populate details** - Use alert data to fill incident forms
  - **Consistent severities** - Map alert priorities to incident severities logically
  - **Invite the right people** - Use workflows to automatically bring in relevant responders
</Accordion>

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

- **[Why is an alert missing an attribute?](/help-centre/alerts/why-is-an-alert-missing-an-attribute)** - Debug missing or incorrect alert attributes
- **[Does incident.io support Heartbeat monitoring?](/help-centre/alerts/does-incident-io-support-heartbeat-monitoring)** - Information about heartbeat checks
- **[HTTP alert sources JSON array limitation](/help-centre/http-alert-sources-json-array-limitation-and-troubleshooting)** - Troubleshooting custom integrations
