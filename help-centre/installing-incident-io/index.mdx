## Installation Guide

### Step 1: Sign Up via Slack

From the [sign-up page](https://app.incident.io/), click **'Sign in with Slack'**.

![Sign in with Slack](/images/help-centre/installing-incident.io-in-30-seconds/screenshot-1.png)

We'll create an account for you and store some basic information, like your name and avatar. We'll also ask for a restricted set of permissions in order for incident.io to work.

<Info>

### Step 2: Select Your Integrations

This step helps us understand the most-used tools in our user base. Don't worry - you can set up your actual integrations later!

### Step 3: Add incident.io to Slack

The final step: click **'Add incident.io to Slack'**.

![Add to Slack](/images/help-centre/installing-incident.io-in-30-seconds/screenshot-4.png)

When you've done this, we'll create an #incidents channel and install the incident.io app into your workspace.

**...all done!**

<Note>
**Onboarding your team**

**Everyone in your Slack workspace can now use incident.io** — they simply need to go through the same '[Login with Slack](http://app.incident.io/)' flow. They will not be asked to 'Add incident.io to Slack' - that step only happens once per workspace.
</Note>

## Important Notes

<Warning>
**Slack Admin Required**

You will need a Slack admin to install incident.io due to Slack's permissioning model. This is a Slack requirement, not something we can work around.
</Warning>

<Info>
**Slash Command Conflicts**

The incident.io app uses `/inc` and `/incident` as slash commands. If you already have an app installed that uses either of these commands, Slack will default to using the most recently installed app when that command is run.

Don't worry - you can still use incident.io! Check out our [troubleshooting guide](/help-centre/installing-incident-io/troubleshooting/will-incident.io-clash-with-existing-commands-in-slack) for solutions.

## Understanding Privileged Access

Depending on your Slack workspace settings, incident.io may need privileged access to perform certain actions. This is completely normal and secure.

    Learn what privileged Slack access enables and why it's required
  </Card>
  <Card title="Creating a Service Account" icon="user-gear" href="/help-centre/installing-incident-io/creating-a-slack-admin-for-privileged-slack-access">
    Set up a dedicated Slack admin account for incident.io (recommended)
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### What does privileged access enable?

Privileged Slack access allows incident.io to:

- **Create private incident channels** for sensitive incidents
- **Create public incident channels** when workspace settings restrict this to admins
- **Archive old incident channels** automatically to keep your workspace tidy
- **Manage user groups** that reflect current on-call responders
- **Remove users from private channels** when incident access is revoked

<Note>
**Best Practice: Create a Service Account**

We strongly recommend creating a dedicated Slack account for incident.io rather than using a personal admin account. This keeps things clear, protects private data, and ensures channels show "Created by incident.io".

</Note>

### Common Permission Scenarios

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="My workspace restricts channel creation to admins">
    You'll need to connect a Slack Workspace Admin or Owner account to enable incident.io to create incident channels. We recommend creating a service account specifically for this purpose.

  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="I want to use private incidents">
    To manage private incident channels, you'll need to connect a Slack Workspace Owner account (not just an Admin). The connected owner will be invited to all private incidents.

  <Accordion title="I need to sync on-call schedules with Slack user groups">
    To create and manage user groups that reflect your on-call schedules, you'll need to connect a Slack admin or owner with user group permissions.
