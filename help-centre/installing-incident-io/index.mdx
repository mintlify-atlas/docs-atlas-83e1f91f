</Info>

## Quick Start: Install in 30 Seconds

Get incident.io up and running with these three simple steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign Up via Slack">
    Visit the [sign-up page](https://app.incident.io/) and click 'Sign in with Slack'. We'll create an account for you and store basic information like your name and avatar.
    
    ![Sign up with Slack](/images/help-centre/installing-incident.io-in-30-seconds/screenshot-1.png)
    
    <Note>
    We only request the permissions necessary for incident.io to function. Learn more in our [Security FAQs](https://docs.incident.io/security-faqs).
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select Your Integrations">
    Tell us about the tools you use. This helps us understand our user base and you can set up detailed integrations later.
    
    ![Select integrations](/images/help-centre/installing-incident.io-in-30-seconds/screenshot-3.png)
    
    You can configure your integrations in detail [here](/help-centre/api-and-integrations).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add incident.io to Slack">
    Click 'Add incident.io to Slack' to complete the installation.
    
    ![Add to Slack](/images/help-centre/installing-incident.io-in-30-seconds/screenshot-4.png)
    
    We'll automatically create an #incidents channel and install the app in your workspace.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
**All done!** Everyone in your Slack workspace can now use incident.io by going through the same 'Login with Slack' flow. They won't need to reinstall - that step only happens once.

## Important Notes

<Warning>
**Slack Admin Required**: You'll need a Slack admin to install incident.io due to Slack's permissioning model.
</Warning>

<Note>
**Slash Commands**: The app uses `/inc` and `/incident` as slash commands. If you already have an app installed that uses either of these commands, Slack will default to using the most recently installed app when that command is run.
</Note>

## Advanced Installation Topics

Depending on your Slack workspace configuration, you may need to understand privileged access requirements:

## Understanding Privileged Access

Depending on your Slack workspace settings, incident.io may need privileged access for certain features:

### Channel Management

incident.io needs appropriate permissions to:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create Private Channels" icon="lock">
    If your workspace restricts private channel creation to admins/owners, you'll need to connect a Slack admin for [private incidents](/help-centre/creating-and-running-incidents/faqs/can-we-mark-incidents-as-sensitive-and-restrict-access).
    
    **Recommendation**: Create a dedicated Slack user for this purpose to avoid confusion.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Create Public Channels" icon="hashtag">
    If public channel creation is restricted, you'll need to connect a Slack admin or owner. This user will appear as the channel creator for all incident channels.
    
    **Recommendation**: Create a dedicated incident.io service account.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Archive Channels" icon="box-archive">
    For automatic archival of old incident channels, connect a Slack admin or owner. This user will be added to channels temporarily to archive them.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Manage Channel Members" icon="users">
    To automatically remove users from private incidents with `/incident revoke`, you'll need to connect a Slack Workspace Owner.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### User Group Management

For on-call schedule integration:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Create User Groups" icon="users-gear">
    If your workspace restricts user group creation, connect a Slack admin to enable [on-call schedule synchronization](/help-centre/on-call/schedules/how-to-sync-your-on-call-schedules-with-slack-user-groups).
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Modify User Groups" icon="pen-to-square">
    For automatic updates when on-call shifts change, connect a Slack admin to enable dynamic user group management.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
You can check your Slack permissions at [https://app.slack.com/admin/permissions/account-types](https://app.slack.com/admin/permissions/account-types)
