## Common Scribe Errors

### [Scribe and Incident Calls Overview](/help-centre/scribe-and-incident-calls/scribe-and-incident-calls)

Understand the most common errors you might encounter when using Scribe and how to resolve them.

### Call Not Found

<Warning>
No call could be found for the given incident, preventing Scribe from joining.
</Warning>

**Resolution:**
- Start a new call for the incident
- Update the call link to an existing call URL
- Scribe will automatically join the updated call

### Scribe Cannot Join Multiple Calls

**Issue:** Multiple active calls exist for a single incident.

**Resolution:**
1. End one of the active calls
2. If the error persists, contact support
3. Ensure only one call link is active per incident

### Scribe Was Blocked

<Note>
This error occurs when meeting restrictions prevent Scribe from joining.
</Note>

**Common Causes:**
- Google Meet guest restrictions enabled
- Zoom security settings blocking external participants
- Meeting host has disabled web client access

**Resolution:**
- Check your video conferencing platform's guest access settings
- Ensure web clients are allowed to join meetings
- Review meeting security configurations

### Scribe Was Removed

**Issue:** The meeting host removed Scribe from the call.

**Resolution:**
- Add Scribe again from the incident dashboard
- Communicate with your team about Scribe's role in incidents
- Configure automatic Scribe joining if available

### Rate Limited

<Info>
Some providers limit the number of calls that can be created within a specific time period.
</Info>

**Example:** Zoom may impose a limit of 100 calls per day per user account.

**Resolution:**
- Consider disabling automatic incident call creation
- Use a different user account for the integration
- Spread call creation across multiple authorized users

## Zoom-Specific Issues

### [Zoom: Diagnosing Common Issues](/help-centre/scribe-and-incident-calls/zoom-diagnosing-common-issues)

#### Meeting Not Found

**Cause:** Unable to fetch information about the current call.

**Resolution:**
- Verify the call URL is correct
- Ensure the Zoom account used for integration can access the call
- Check that the meeting exists and is active

#### Host Has Disallowed Web Clients

<Warning>
The meeting host has forbidden joining from the web, blocking Scribe access.
</Warning>

**Common Causes:**
- E2E encryption enabled for the call
- Zoom account settings restricting web client access

**Resolution:**
- Disable E2E encryption for incident calls
- Update Zoom account settings to allow web clients
- Configure meeting templates with appropriate settings

#### Scribe Not Joining Calls

**Issue:** Scribe is enabled but doesn't join your calls.

**Resolution:**
1. Re-authenticate the Zoom integration to ensure latest permissions
2. Verify recording is allowed in your Zoom app settings
3. Check that all required permissions are granted

#### Missing Transcripts

<Note>
Scribe relies on Zoom meeting captions to generate transcripts.
</Note>

**Resolution:**
1. Enable **Allow Closed Captioning** in **Host Caption Control Settings** during meetings
2. Navigate to [Zoom settings](https://zoom.us/profile/setting?tab=meeting)
3. Enable **Automated captions** toggle
4. For new Zoom installations, ensure shared access permissions are enabled
