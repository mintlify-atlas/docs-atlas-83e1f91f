## Overview

The real value of incidents comes not just from resolving them, but from learning and improving afterward. A strong post-incident process helps you extract insights, complete follow-ups, and prevent similar issues in the future.

## Incident Timeline

<Accordion title="Automatic Timeline Generation">
  incident.io acts as your scribe during incidents, automatically capturing:
  
  - **Incident updates** - Severity changes, status transitions
  - **Pinned messages** - Important Slack messages
  - **Role assignments** - Who was involved and when
  - **Actions** - Tasks created, assigned, and completed
  - **Integrations** - GitHub PRs, Sentry errors, deployments
  - **Images** - Screenshots posted in the channel
  
  No more retroactively parsing through hundreds of Slack messages to build a timeline - it's done for you in real-time.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Editing and Enriching Timelines">
  While the automatic timeline provides a great foundation, you can enhance it:
  
  **From the activity log:**
  - Add relevant events that weren't automatically included
  - Filter through all detected events
  - Click the plus icon to add events to the timeline
  
  **From Slack:**
  - Pin messages during the incident (or retroactively)
  - Messages are timestamped when posted, not when pinned
  - Don't worry if you forgot to pin in the moment
  
  **Custom events:**
  - Add events that happened outside the incident channel
  - Include customer reports, deployments, or external events
  - Provide timestamp and description
  
  **Edit details:**
  - Update event titles for clarity
  - Add descriptions with additional context
  - Reorder events if needed
</Accordion>

## Follow-ups

<Note>
  **Two types of actions**
  
  During incidents, you create two distinct types of actions:
  
  **Actions (Do Now):**
  - Reboot that server
  - Send comms to affected customers
  - Deploy the hotfix
  
  **Follow-ups (Do Later):**
  - Improve test coverage
  - Update documentation
  - Share debrief with stakeholders
  - Implement monitoring improvements
</Note>

### Creating Follow-ups

There are three ways to create follow-ups:

<Steps>
  <Step title="React with emoji">
    React with the :fast_forward: emoji to any Slack message in the incident channel to turn it into a follow-up
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Use slash command">
    Type `/inc follow-up` to create new follow-ups or view existing ones
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Link from issue tracker">
    Create a ticket in Jira/Linear/GitHub and paste the link in the incident channel - it's automatically tracked as a follow-up
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Managing Follow-ups

**Edit and update:**
- If exported to Jira/Linear, changes sync automatically
- Edit in Slack with `/inc follow-ups`
- Edit via the incident homepage Follow-ups tab
- Assign priorities to follow-ups

**Track completion:**
- View all follow-ups on the [Follow-ups page](https://app.incident.io/follow-ups)
- See status across all incidents
- Send reminders for overdue follow-ups
- Bulk-edit multiple follow-ups

Learn more about [Follow-ups](/help-centre/learning-from-incidents/follow-ups).

### Follow-up Priorities

Assign priorities to follow-ups to:

- Communicate urgency and importance
- Drive enforcement with Policies
- Filter and sort in the follow-ups dashboard
- Report on completion rates by priority

See [Assigning a Priority to Follow-ups](/help-centre/learning-from-incidents/assigning-a-priority-to-follow-ups).

## Post-mortems

<Accordion title="Creating Post-mortems in 3 Clicks">

  The post-mortem includes:
  - Incident summary and metadata
  - Complete timeline with timestamps
  - List of follow-ups
  - Participants and roles
  - Custom fields and attributes
  - Links back to the incident
  
  All you need to do is add analysis and learnings.

- **incident.io editor** - Built-in collaborative editor
- **Notion** - If you use Notion for documentation
- **Google Docs** - For Google Workspace users
- **Confluence** - For Atlassian users
- **Custom integration** - Use the API to integrate with any tool

See [Where should I write my post-mortem?](/help-centre/learning-from-incidents/where-should-i-write-my-post-mortem) for guidance.

### Sharing Post-mortems

Once complete, share your post-mortem:

- **Internal sharing** - Post to Slack channels
- **Stakeholder distribution** - Email to affected teams

## Debriefs

<Info>
  **What is a debrief?**
  
  A debrief is a meeting where the incident response team discusses:
  
  - What happened and why
  - What went well
  - What could be improved
  - Action items to prevent recurrence
  
  Debriefs are most effective when held within 24-48 hours of incident resolution, while details are still fresh.
</Info>

**Running effective debriefs:**

- **Blameless** - Focus on systems and processes, not individuals
- **Structured** - Use the timeline to guide discussion
- **Action-oriented** - Create concrete follow-ups
- **Inclusive** - Include all key participants
- **Time-boxed** - 30-60 minutes typically

**Debrief best practices:**

- Schedule automatically with the Post-incident Flow
- Prepare by reviewing the timeline beforehand
- Designate a facilitator and note-taker
- Use Google Calendar integration for scheduling
- Record (with permission) for those who can't attend

Learn more about [What is a debrief?](/help-centre/learning-from-incidents/what-is-a-debrief) and [Google Calendar permissions](/help-centre/debriefs:-google-calendar-permissions).

## Shoutouts

<Accordion title="Recognizing Great Incident Response">
  Shoutouts let you recognize team members who did exceptional work during an incident:
  
  - Acknowledge heroic efforts
  - Highlight great communication
  - Recognize quick thinking
  - Build team morale
  - Reinforce positive behaviors
  
  Shoutouts can be:
  - Given during or after the incident
  - Shared in incident updates
  - Posted to team channels
  - Included in post-mortems
  - Tracked for performance reviews
</Accordion>

Learn about [Shoutouts](/help-centre/learning-from-incidents/shoutouts).

## Post-incident Tasks

### Setting Default Assignees

Automate follow-up assignment:

- Assign all follow-ups to the Incident Lead by default
- Route to specific people based on incident type
- Use workflows to assign based on affected service

See [Setting a default assignee for your post-incident tasks](/help-centre/learning-from-incidents/setting-a-default-assignee-for-your-post-incident-tasks).

### Due Dates and Reminders

Keep follow-ups on track:

- Set due dates when creating follow-ups
- Configure default due dates by priority
- Automatic reminders before due date
- Escalation for overdue items
- Track completion metrics

Learn about [Setting due dates and reminders for your post-incident tasks](/help-centre/learning-from-incidents/setting-due-dates-and-reminders-for-your-post-incident-tasks).

## Post-incident Flow

<Note>
  **Automate your post-incident process**
  
  The Post-incident Flow guides teams through a consistent process after incidents:
  
  - Timeline review and cleanup
  - Post-mortem creation
  - Debrief scheduling
  - Follow-up assignment
  - Stakeholder communication
  
  Configure the flow to match your organization's process and ensure nothing is missed.
