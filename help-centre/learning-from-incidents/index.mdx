<Info>
The real value of incident management comes after resolution. A strong post-incident process helps teams learn, improve, and prevent future incidents.
</Info>

## Overview

Learning from incidents is about extracting maximum value from things that went wrong. This involves reviewing what happened, documenting lessons learned, creating actionable follow-ups, and sharing knowledge across the organization.

incident.io provides tools to make the post-incident process smooth and effective:

- **Automatic timeline generation** from incident activity
- **Follow-up tracking** and assignment
- **Collaborative post-mortem editing**
- **Knowledge sharing** and distribution
- **Debrief scheduling** and coordination

## Incident Timeline

### Automatic Timeline Generation

While you're focused on resolving the incident, incident.io automatically builds a timeline:

**Automatically captured events:**
- Incident status changes (declared, escalated, resolved)
- Severity changes
- Role assignments and changes
- Incident updates and announcements
- Pinned Slack messages
- Action items created and completed
- GitHub commits and pull requests
- Sentry errors
- Images and screenshots posted to channel

<Note>
You don't need to think about documentation during an incident. Just pin important messages and focus on resolution. incident.io captures everything for later review.
</Note>

### Curating Your Timeline

After resolution, refine the timeline to tell a clear story:

<Accordion title="Adding Events">
**From Activity Log:**
- Review all detected events in the left panel
- Add relevant role changes, GitHub activity, Sentry errors
- Click + to add to timeline

**From Slack:**
- Pin messages during or after the incident
- Use 📌 emoji or Slack's "Pin to channel" command
- Automatically timestamped when message was posted

**Custom Events:**
- Add events that happened outside Slack
- Customer reports, phone calls, external communications
- Specify timestamp and description
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Editing Events">
- Add context and descriptions to auto-generated events
- Correct timestamps if needed
- Add commentary explaining significance
- Remove irrelevant events
- Reorder for narrative clarity
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Collaborative Review">
- Start discussions on timeline events
- Tag responders for clarification
- Resolve ambiguities before debrief
- Document different perspectives
</Accordion>

## Follow-Ups

### Creating Follow-Ups

Follow-ups are action items that should be completed after an incident to prevent recurrence or improve process:

**Three ways to create:**

<Accordion title="React with emoji">
1. Find a relevant message in incident channel
2. React with ⏩ (fast_forward) emoji
3. Follow-up created with message context
4. Export to Jira, Linear, or other issue tracker

**Best for:** Converting discussion points into actionable tasks
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Use /inc follow-up command">
1. Type `/inc follow-up` in incident channel
2. Fill out follow-up details
3. Assign owner and priority
4. Track in incident.io or export to issue tracker

**Best for:** Creating structured follow-ups with clear ownership
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Create in issue tracker and link">
1. Create issue in Jira, Linear, GitHub, etc.
2. Paste link in incident channel
3. incident.io automatically associates with incident
4. Status synced from issue tracker

**Best for:** Following existing workflow in your issue tracker
</Accordion>

- Block incident closure until high-priority follow-ups assigned
- Automatic reminders at configurable intervals

[Configure follow-up policies →](/help-centre/configure-your-account/enforcing-follow-ups-are-completed-based-on-priority-(policies))

## Post-Mortems

### Creating Post-Mortems

Post-mortems document what happened, why, and what you'll do about it:

**Quick creation options:**

<Accordion title="3-click post-mortem">
1. Click "Create post-mortem" in incident.io
2. Choose template and destination (Notion, Google Docs, Confluence)
3. Post-mortem created with timeline and incident details pre-filled

[3-click post-mortem guide →](/help-centre/learning-from-incidents/creating-postmortems-in-3-clicks)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Collaborative editor">
Use incident.io's built-in post-mortem editor:
- Real-time collaboration
- Timeline automatically included
- Markdown support
- Comments and discussions
- Version history
- Export to any format

[Collaborative editor guide →](/help-centre/learning-from-incidents/using-our-collaborative-post-mortem-editor)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="External document">
Write in your preferred tool:
- Notion, Google Docs, Confluence, etc.
- Link document to incident
- incident.io provides timeline data to paste

[Where to write post-mortems →](/help-centre/learning-from-incidents/where-should-i-write-my-post-mortem)
</Accordion>

### Post-Mortem Structure

Typical sections in a post-mortem:

**Summary:**
- What happened (one paragraph)
- Impact (customers affected, duration, services impacted)
- Root cause (what actually went wrong)

**Timeline:**
- Automatically generated from incident
- Key events with timestamps
- Decision points and actions taken

**What Went Well:**
- Positive aspects of response
- Effective processes or tools
- Good decisions made under pressure

**What Could Be Improved:**
- Areas for improvement
- Gaps in monitoring, alerting, or documentation
- Process failures or delays

**Action Items:**
- Specific follow-ups to prevent recurrence
- Process improvements
- Technical debt to address
- Ownership and deadlines

**Lessons Learned:**
- Key takeaways
- Knowledge to share with wider team
- Questions raised for future consideration

<Note>
**Focus on learning, not blame**: Post-mortems should be blameless. The goal is to understand system failures and improve processes, not to point fingers.
</Note>

### Sharing Post-Mortems

Distribute learnings across the organization:

**Sharing options:**
- Post in company-wide Slack channel
- Email to relevant stakeholders
- Add to post-mortem repository
- Include in team all-hands
- Share with affected customers (external version)

**Audience considerations:**
- **Internal technical**: Full details, root cause analysis
- **Internal non-technical**: High-level summary, impact, prevention
- **External**: Customer-focused, what they experienced, how you responded

[Sharing post-mortems guide →](/help-centre/learning-from-incidents/sharing-your-post-mortems)

## Debriefs

### What is a Debrief?

A debrief is a meeting where the incident response team discusses:

- What happened during the incident
- How the response went
- What could be improved
- Follow-up actions needed

**Key characteristics:**
- Held shortly after incident resolution (within 1-2 days)
- Includes all responders and key stakeholders
- Blameless and focused on learning
- Typically 30-60 minutes
- Results in action items and learnings

[What is a debrief? →](/help-centre/learning-from-incidents/what-is-a-debrief)

### When to Hold Debriefs

Not every incident needs a debrief:

**Always debrief:**
- Critical or high severity incidents
- Customer-impacting outages
- Security incidents
- Incidents with novel root causes
- Incidents where response could be improved

**Consider debriefing:**
- Medium severity incidents with interesting learnings
- Repeated incidents (pattern recognition)
- Incidents that took longer than expected to resolve

**Skip debrief:**
- Low severity, routine incidents
- Well-understood issues with quick resolution
- When learnings already captured in post-mortem

### Running Effective Debriefs

<Accordion title="Before the debrief">
**Preparation:**
- Schedule within 1-2 days of resolution
- Invite all responders and relevant stakeholders
- Share timeline and draft post-mortem in advance
- Ask participants to review and add questions
- Designate facilitator (not the Incident Lead)
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="During the debrief">
**Structure:**
1. **Recap** (5 min): Walk through timeline
2. **Discussion** (30-40 min): Explore questions and observations
3. **Action items** (10 min): Agree on follow-ups
4. **Learnings** (5 min): Summarize key takeaways

**Facilitation tips:**
- Keep discussion blameless
- Encourage all voices to be heard
- Focus on "what" and "how", not "who"
- Dig deeper on interesting points
- Timebox discussions that go long
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="After the debrief">
**Follow-up:**
- Update post-mortem with debrief insights
- Create or update follow-up action items
- Share finalized post-mortem
- Track follow-ups to completion
- Archive recording (if recorded)
</Accordion>

## Additional Features

### Shoutouts

Recognize great work during incidents:

- Give shoutouts to responders who went above and beyond
- Celebrate effective collaboration
- Highlight learning moments
- Build positive incident culture

[Shoutouts guide →](/help-centre/learning-from-incidents/shoutouts)

### Finding Links

Quickly locate resources shared during an incident:

- All links posted in incident channel
- Categorized by type (docs, dashboards, logs, etc.)
- Searchable and filterable
- Useful for post-mortem writing

[Finding links →](/help-centre/learning-from-incidents/quickly-finding-links-in-an-incident's-channel)

## Best Practices

<Warning>
**Don't skip the post-incident process**: It's tempting to move on after resolution, but the learning phase is where the real value lies. Budget time for it.
</Warning>

### Post-Incident Process Tips

1. **Start during the incident**: Pin important messages as they happen
2. **Debrief while fresh**: Schedule within 24-48 hours of resolution
3. **Make it blameless**: Focus on systems and processes, not individuals
4. **Be specific**: Vague follow-ups like "improve monitoring" don't get done
5. **Assign owners**: Every follow-up needs a clear owner
6. **Set deadlines**: Follow-ups without deadlines drift indefinitely
7. **Track to completion**: Review follow-up progress in regular meetings
8. **Share widely**: Learnings benefit teams beyond those directly involved

### Building a Learning Culture

<Note>
**Celebrate incidents**: They're opportunities to learn and improve. Teams that embrace this mindset get better faster.
</Note>

**Cultural elements:**
- **Blameless post-mortems**: Focus on systems, not people
- **Psychological safety**: People must feel safe raising issues
- **Continuous improvement**: Small changes compound over time
- **Transparency**: Share incidents and learnings openly
- **Follow-through**: Actually complete the follow-ups

### Common Pitfalls

**To avoid:**
- Writing post-mortems but not doing follow-ups
- Making follow-ups too vague or broad
- Not scheduling debriefs until memory fades
- Making post-mortems onerous (discourages writing them)
- Only doing post-mortems for big incidents (miss patterns)
- Treating post-mortems as compliance checkbox

## Configuration

### Post-Incident Flow

Define your organization's post-incident process:

- Required steps (timeline review, post-mortem, debrief)
- Automatic reminders and nudges
- Default follow-up assignees
- Post-mortem templates
- Integration with documentation tools

[Configure post-incident flow →](/help-centre/configure-your-account/define-your-post-incident-process-using-the-post-incident-flow)

### Templates

Create templates for consistency:

- **Post-mortem templates**: Standard sections and questions
- **Follow-up templates**: Common preventive actions
- **Debrief agendas**: Discussion guide

Templates ensure nothing important is missed while speeding up the process.

## Tracking and Insights

Measure the effectiveness of your post-incident process:

**Metrics to track:**
- Post-mortem completion rate
- Time from resolution to post-mortem
- Follow-up completion rate
- Time to complete follow-ups
- Repeated incidents (did follow-ups prevent recurrence?)

**Use insights to:**
- Identify teams that need support with post-incident process
- Find patterns in follow-ups (common improvements needed)
- Measure ROI of incident learning
- Celebrate teams with strong post-incident practices
