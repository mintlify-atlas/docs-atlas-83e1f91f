## Post-Incident Process

<Steps>
  <Step title="Immediate aftermath (Day 0)">
    Right after resolution:
    
    - Review the automatically generated timeline
    - Schedule a debrief (ideally within 24-48 hours)
    - Create initial follow-up items while fresh in mind
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Conduct the debrief (Day 1-2)">
    Gather the team to discuss what happened:
    
    - Walk through the timeline together
    - Identify what went well and what didn't
    - Discuss contributing factors
    - Brainstorm action items
    
    [What is a debrief? →](/help-centre/learning-from-incidents/what-is-a-debrief)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Write the post-mortem (Day 2-5)">
    Document findings in a structured post-mortem:
    
    - Use the draft generated from the debrief
    - Add context and analysis
    - Link to relevant data and evidence
    - List all follow-up actions
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Share and discuss (Day 5-7)">
    Circulate the post-mortem for feedback:
    
    - Share with affected teams
    - Present at engineering all-hands if significant
    - Incorporate feedback and finalize
    - Add to your post-mortem repository
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Track follow-ups (Ongoing)">
    Ensure action items are completed:
    
    - Regular check-ins on progress
    - Update due dates if priorities shift
    - Celebrate when follow-ups are completed
    - Measure how many follow-ups actually get done
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Timely Debriefs" icon="clock">
    Conduct debriefs within 24-48 hours while memories are fresh. Waiting too long means lost context.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Blameless Culture" icon="shield-heart">
    Focus on systems and processes, not individuals. Blame-free analysis leads to deeper learning.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Actionable Follow-ups" icon="bullseye">
    Create specific, measurable follow-ups with clear owners and due dates. Vague actions don't get done.
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Share Learnings" icon="share-nodes">
    Distribute post-mortems widely. Other teams can learn from your incidents and prevent similar issues.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
The goal of post-incident analysis is learning and improvement, not punishment. Create a culture where people feel safe discussing what went wrong.
</Note>
