## Infrastructure & Platform

### [What platform does incident.io run on?](/help-centre/security-faqs/what-platform-does-incident.io-run-on)

Our infrastructure is built on **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, providing enterprise-grade security and reliability:

**Architecture:**
- Primary web application and Slack integration deployed on GCP
- PostgreSQL database (securely hosted and managed by GCP)
- BigQuery platform for analytics
- **All data encrypted at rest** in both Postgres and BigQuery

**Security Controls:**
- Two-factor authentication required for all access
- IAM policies restricting resource access
- Regular security audits and updates

### [Where is our data stored?](/help-centre/security-faqs/where-is-our-data-stored)

<Info>
**All data is stored within Europe.** We currently don't send any data outside of Europe.
</Info>

**Data Locations:**

**Transactional Processing** (Slackbot interactions, dashboard access):
- Primary: GCP Belgium region ([europe-west1](https://cloud.google.com/about/locations#europe))
- Hot standby: GCP Netherlands region ([europe-west4](https://cloud.google.com/about/locations#europe))

**Analytical Processing** (internal analytics):
- Stored [within Europe](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/locations) on BigQuery

## Authentication & Access

### [How do you authenticate users?](/help-centre/security-faqs/how-do-you-authenticate-users)

We use **Slack as our authentication mechanism**, eliminating the need for separate credentials:

**Authentication Flow:**
- Your organization's Slack authentication method is used (direct or SSO)
- No additional authentication provider required
- Temporary web sessions granted via OAuth flow
- Sessions periodically expire and are automatically refreshed
- Tokens can be revoked at any time

<Note>
Whatever authentication method your organization uses for Slack (including SAML/SSO providers) is automatically used to access incident.io.
</Note>

### [Slack Permissions & Access Scopes](/help-centre/security-faqs/what-slack-permissions-and-access-scopes-do-you-require)

We follow the principle of least privilege, requesting only the Slack permissions necessary for incident.io to function. Visit the detailed article to see the specific scopes we require and why.

## Data Management
