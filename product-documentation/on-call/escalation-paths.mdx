Escalation paths ensure thorough response plans when alerts fire, automatically notifying the right people at the right time. They define multiple levels of responders, notification timing, and escalation behavior to guarantee alerts reach someone who can respond.

## What are escalation paths

On-call schedules define who is available when incidents happen. Escalation paths ensure alerts reach those people, with automatic escalation to additional responders if initial pages aren't acknowledged.

Escalation paths are used in:
- **Alert routes** - Automatically page responders when alerts fire
- **Workflows** - Programmatically escalate during incident response
- **Manual escalations** - Page people from the incident dashboard

## Creating escalation paths

Set up escalation paths in **On-call → Escalation paths**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create new path">
    Navigate to **On-call → Escalation paths** and click **Create escalation path**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Name and describe">
    Give the escalation path a descriptive name (e.g., "Platform team escalation") and optional description
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add levels">
    Add one or more escalation levels. For each level:
    - Choose between **Schedule** (page whoever is currently on-call) or **User** (page specific individuals)
    - Set the acknowledgment timeout (how long to wait before escalating)
    - Configure notification preferences
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure urgency behavior (optional)">
    Set different escalation behavior for different alert priorities or urgency levels
  </Step>
  <Step title="Link to team (optional)">
    Link the escalation path to a team for automatic filtering and catalog relationships
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save">
    Save the escalation path
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Escalation levels

Each escalation path contains one or more levels. Levels execute sequentially:

1. **Level 1** fires immediately when the escalation is triggered
2. If not acknowledged within the timeout, **Level 2** fires
3. If still not acknowledged, **Level 3** fires
4. This continues through all levels

### Schedule vs. User levels

**Schedule levels** page whoever is currently on-call in a schedule:
- Dynamic - automatically follows schedule rotations
- Best for primary on-call responders
- Supports follow-the-sun and rotation-based coverage

**User levels** page specific individuals:
- Static - always pages the same people regardless of schedule
- Best for escalating to managers, subject matter experts, or backup contacts
- Useful for final escalation levels when schedules are exhausted

### Acknowledgment timeouts

Set how long incident.io waits for acknowledgment before escalating to the next level:

- **Standard timeouts** - 5, 10, 15, or 30 minutes
- **Custom timeouts** - Set any duration that fits your needs
- **Immediate escalation** - Set to 0 minutes to page multiple levels simultaneously

<Tip>
Set shorter timeouts for high-priority alerts and longer timeouts for lower-priority alerts using urgency-based escalation.
</Tip>

## Smart escalation paths

Smart escalation paths adjust behavior based on alert context, such as priority or urgency level. Configure different escalation strategies for different situations:

**Example: Priority-based escalation**
- **P1 alerts** - Page senior engineers immediately, escalate to managers after 10 minutes
- **P2 alerts** - Page on-call engineer, escalate to senior engineers after 20 minutes
- **P3 alerts** - Page on-call engineer, escalate to team after 30 minutes

Configure urgency rules when creating or editing an escalation path. Each urgency level can override:
- Escalation levels (who gets paged)
- Timeouts (how long to wait)
- Notification channels (how responders are contacted)

## Round-robin escalation

When multiple responders are on-call at the same level (e.g., multiple people in a schedule or multiple user selections), incident.io can use round-robin distribution:

- **Enabled** - Cycles through responders, paging one person at a time before moving to the next level
- **Disabled** (default) - Pages all responders at the current level simultaneously

Use round-robin to reduce alert fatigue by spreading pages across team members rather than notifying everyone simultaneously.

<Info>
Round-robin state persists across escalations, ensuring fair distribution of pages over time.
</Info>

## Working hours and delays

Control when escalations fire based on working hours:

### Delay until working hours

Configure escalation paths to delay pages until working hours begin:
- Set working hours (e.g., Monday-Friday 9:00-17:00)
- Alerts that fire outside working hours wait until the next working period
- Useful for non-critical alerts that don't require immediate response

<Warning>
Delaying until working hours means responders won't be paged immediately. Only use this for low-priority alerts where delayed response is acceptable.
</Warning>

### No one on-call behavior

When no one is on-call in a schedule level:
- **Skip level** - Move immediately to the next escalation level
- **Wait for next shift** - Delay escalation until someone comes on-call
- **Page specific backup** - Define fallback users when schedules have gaps

Configure this behavior per escalation path to handle expected gaps in schedule coverage.

## Connecting to alert routes

Escalation paths only trigger when connected to an alert source:

1. Create alert sources in **Settings → Alerts**
2. Create schedules in **On-call → Schedules**
3. Create escalation paths in **On-call → Escalation paths**
4. Create alert routes in **Settings → Alerts → Routes**
5. Configure alert routes to use escalation paths

See [Alert routing](/product-documentation/on-call/alert-routing) for detailed configuration.

## Linking to teams

Link escalation paths to teams to:
- Enable automatic filtering (team members see their escalation paths first)
- Create catalog relationships for dynamic routing
- Use expressions like `Alert > Team > Escalation paths` in alert routes

When you link an escalation path to a team, incident.io automatically updates the catalog relationship, enabling dynamic alert routing based on team ownership.

## Manual escalation

Manually escalate from the incident dashboard:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open incident">
    Navigate to the incident homepage
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click escalate">
    Click **Escalate** in the incident header or actions menu
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select escalation path">
    Choose an escalation path from the list
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure (optional)">
    Adjust levels or timeouts for this specific escalation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Trigger escalation">
    Click **Escalate** to page responders
  </Step>
</Steps>

Manual escalations follow the same notification and timeout behavior as automated escalations from alert routes.

## Escalation states

Escalations progress through several states:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Triggered** | Escalation is active and paging responders |
| **Acknowledged** | A responder has acknowledged the page |
| **Cancelled** | Escalation was cancelled manually or automatically (e.g., alert resolved) |
| **Expired** | All levels completed without acknowledgment |

<Info>
Acknowledging an escalation does not resolve the underlying alert. Alerts must be resolved separately.
</Info>

## Best practices

### Use multiple levels

Always include at least 2-3 escalation levels to ensure alerts eventually reach someone. Single-level escalations risk alerts going unacknowledged.

### Set reasonable timeouts

Balance urgency with giving responders time to acknowledge:
- **Too short** - Escalates before responders can wake up, check their phone, and respond
- **Too long** - Delays getting help for critical issues
- **Typical range** - 10-15 minutes for initial levels, 5-10 minutes for subsequent levels

### Link to teams

Always link escalation paths to teams when possible. This enables dynamic routing and reduces configuration overhead as team ownership changes.

### Test escalation paths

Use test alerts or manual escalations to verify:
- Responders receive notifications on all configured channels
- Timeouts and escalation logic work as expected
- Critical notifications bypass Do Not Disturb mode
- Acknowledgment stops escalation appropriately

### Use smart escalation for priority-based behavior

Configure different escalation strategies for different priorities. P1 alerts should escalate more aggressively (shorter timeouts, escalate to senior engineers sooner) than P3 alerts.

### Document escalation paths

Add descriptions to escalation paths explaining when they should be used and any special considerations. This helps team members choose the right path when manually escalating.

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens if no one acknowledges at any level?">
    If all escalation levels complete without acknowledgment, the escalation enters "expired" state. The alert remains active but no further automatic pages are sent. Consider:
    - Adding more escalation levels
    - Setting up monitoring to alert on expired escalations
    - Sending expired escalations to a fallback channel (e.g., Slack) for visibility
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I page multiple schedules at the same level?">
    Yes. Add multiple schedule selections to a single level. All on-call responders from all selected schedules will be paged simultaneously (unless round-robin is enabled).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can the same person be in multiple escalation levels?">
    Yes. If someone is on-call in multiple schedules referenced by different levels, they may be paged multiple times. The system tracks this and handles duplicate pages appropriately.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I cancel an active escalation?">
    Escalations cancel automatically when:
    - Someone acknowledges at any level
    - The underlying alert is resolved
    - The alert route has auto-cancel enabled and the alert resolves
    
    You can also manually cancel escalations from the incident dashboard or alerts page.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do escalations continue if I acknowledge the alert?">
    No. Acknowledging an escalation at any level stops further escalation levels from firing. However, if you acknowledge but don't resolve the alert, it remains active.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I escalate to someone not in a schedule?">
    Yes. Use User levels to page specific individuals regardless of their schedule status. This is useful for escalating to managers, subject matter experts, or other stakeholders.
