Escalation paths define the sequence of people or teams to notify when alerts fire. Configure multi-level escalations with delays, priority-based routing, and working hours conditions to ensure critical alerts always reach someone who can respond.

Escalation paths are triggered automatically via [alert routes](/product-documentation/on-call/alert-routing), manually during incidents, or through [workflow](/product-documentation/workflows/overview) automation.

Configure escalation paths in **On-call → Escalation paths**.

## How escalation paths work

An escalation path consists of one or more levels. At each level, incident.io notifies responders and waits for acknowledgment before moving to the next level.

**Basic escalation flow:**

1. Alert fires and triggers an escalation path
2. **Level 1**: Notify the first responder(s)
3. Wait for acknowledgment (configurable delay)
4. If not acknowledged, move to **Level 2**
5. Continue through all levels until someone acknowledges

<Info>
If no one acknowledges after all levels are exhausted, the escalation expires. Configure enough levels and responders to ensure coverage.

## Create an escalation path

<Steps>
  <Step title="Name your escalation path">
    Navigate to **On-call → Escalation paths** and click **Create escalation path**. Give it a descriptive name like "Platform Team - Business Hours" or "P1 - Infrastructure".
  </Step>
  <Step title="Link to teams (optional)">
    Associate the escalation path with one or more [teams](/product-documentation/on-call/teams) for automatic filtering and catalog relationships.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure working hours (optional)">
    Set working hours to create different escalation behavior during and outside business hours.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add escalation levels">
    Add levels to define who gets notified and when. Each level can notify schedules, individual users, or Slack channels.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up branches (optional)">
    Create conditional branches based on priority or working hours for intelligent routing.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Escalation levels

Each level in an escalation path defines:

- **Who to notify**: Schedules, users, or Slack channels
- **How to notify**: All at once, one by one (round robin), or in sequence
- **Urgency**: High-urgency or low-urgency notifications
- **Delay before escalating**: How long to wait before moving to the next level

### Who to notify

**Schedules**

Notify whoever is currently on-call in a [schedule](/product-documentation/on-call/schedules-overview). When schedules rotate, the escalation path automatically routes to the new responder.

**Individual users**

Notify specific people directly, regardless of schedule. Useful for specialist escalations or when you always want to notify the same person.

**Slack channels**

Escalate to a Slack channel where anyone can acknowledge and take ownership. Best for shared responsibility or final escalation levels.

### Notification strategy

**All at once (parallel)**

Notify everyone at the level simultaneously. The first person to acknowledge stops the escalation. Use for urgent situations requiring fast response.

**One by one (round robin)**

Rotate through responders, trying each in turn. Balances load across team members over time. Use for general coverage where any one person can handle the alert.

**In sequence**

Notify responders in order, trying the first person, then the second, and so on. Use when escalation follows a specific hierarchy or skill level.

### Urgency levels

Set urgency for each level to control notification behavior:

- **High-urgency**: Aggressive notifications (immediate phone calls, critical push notifications)
- **Low-urgency**: Gentler notifications (push notifications, email)

Responders configure notification preferences for each urgency level from **Preferences → On-call notifications**.

### Escalation delays

Configure how long to wait before escalating to the next level:

| Delay type | When to use | Example |
|-----------|-------------|----------|
| **Time-based** | Standard delays | Wait 5 minutes before escalating to Level 2 |
| **Until working hours begin** | Hold escalations outside business hours | Wait until 9am before escalating to management |
| **Until working hours end** | Escalate before business hours end | Escalate at 5pm if not resolved during the day |
| **Don't wait** | Immediate escalation | Notify Slack channel immediately while waiting for primary responder |

## Priority-based branches

Create different escalation paths based on alert priority. Route P1 alerts more aggressively than P2 or P3 alerts.

**To create priority-based branches:**

1. Click **Add branch** when creating or editing an escalation path
2. Select **Priority** as the condition
3. Choose which priorities trigger this branch (e.g., P1 only)
4. Configure escalation levels for this priority
5. Add additional branches for other priorities

**Example: Priority-based escalation**

- **P1 alerts**: Immediately call the on-call engineer with high-urgency, escalate to team lead after 5 minutes
- **P2 alerts**: Send push notification with low-urgency, escalate to Slack channel after 15 minutes
- **P3 alerts**: Post to Slack channel only, no phone calls

<Tip>
Configure priorities in **Settings → Alerts → Priorities** and map alert source severities to these priorities.
</Tip>

## Working hours branches

Create different escalation behavior during and outside working hours. Protect responders from low-urgency pages at night while ensuring critical issues still reach someone.

**To create working hours branches:**

1. Configure working hours for the escalation path (days, times, timezone)
2. Click **Add branch** and select **Working hours**
3. Choose **Within working hours** or **Outside working hours**
4. Configure appropriate escalation levels

**Example: Working hours escalation**

- **Within working hours**: Low-urgency notifications, escalate to Slack after 10 minutes
- **Outside working hours**: Only page for P1 alerts, immediately call on-call engineer with high-urgency

### Combined priority and working hours

Create sophisticated routing with both conditions:

```
Branch 1: Within working hours (any priority)
  → Low-urgency notifications
  → Escalate to Slack after 10 minutes

Branch 2: Outside working hours + P1
  → High-urgency notifications
  → Immediate phone call
  → Escalate to team lead after 5 minutes

Branch 3: Outside working hours + P2/P3
  → Low-urgency notifications
  → Wait until working hours begin before escalating
```

## Round robin escalations

Distribute alert load evenly across team members using round robin:

1. Add a level to your escalation path
2. Select **One by one** as the notification strategy
3. Add a schedule or multiple users
4. incident.io rotates through responders with each new alert

The system remembers position in the rotation across alerts, ensuring fair distribution over time.

<Info>
Round robin works independently from schedules. You can combine both: use a schedule for primary on-call, and round robin for secondary escalation.
</Info>

## Escalate to Slack channels

Add Slack channels as escalation levels to involve broader teams:

1. Add a new level to your escalation path
2. Select **Slack channel** as the target
3. Search for and select a channel
4. Choose urgency and escalation delay

Anyone in the Slack channel can acknowledge the escalation and take ownership.

**Common use cases:**

- Final escalation level when individuals don't acknowledge
- Parallel notification ("Don't wait") to give context while paging responders
- Low-urgency escalations for shared team awareness

## Link escalation paths to teams

Associate escalation paths with [teams](/product-documentation/on-call/teams) to enable dynamic routing:

1. Edit an escalation path
2. Select one or more teams under **Teams**
3. Save the escalation path

incident.io creates a catalog relationship linking the team to the escalation path. Use this in alert routes:

```
Alert > Team > Escalation paths
```

When team ownership changes, routing automatically updates without modifying alert routes.

## Escalation status

Escalations progress through four states:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Triggered** | Escalation started, notifications sent |
| **Acknowledged** | Someone acknowledged, escalation stops |
| **Cancelled** | Escalation cancelled (manually or automatically) |
| **Expired** | No one acknowledged after all levels exhausted |

View escalation status from:
- **On-call → Escalations** in the dashboard
- Alert sidebars
- Incident timelines
- Mobile app

## Auto-cancel escalations

Automatically cancel escalations when alerts resolve:

1. Edit an alert route
2. Enable **Auto-cancel escalations when alerts resolve**
3. Save the route

This prevents pages for issues that have already been resolved by monitoring tools or automation.

## Test escalation paths

Test escalation paths before using them in production:

1. Navigate to **On-call → Escalation paths**
2. Select an escalation path
3. Click **Test escalation**
4. Choose escalation details (priority, time)
5. Click **Send test escalation**

Test escalations create real notifications but are clearly marked as tests.

<Warning>
Test escalations send actual push notifications, SMS, and voice calls. Warn responders before testing.
</Warning>

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens if the same person is on-call at multiple levels?">
    incident.io skips duplicate notifications. If someone is on-call at Level 1 and Level 2, they're only notified at Level 1. If they don't acknowledge, escalation moves to Level 3.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I escalate to multiple schedules simultaneously?">
    Yes. Add multiple schedules to a single level and select **All at once** to notify everyone simultaneously.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I prevent pages during nights and weekends?">
    Use working hours branches to route alerts differently outside business hours. Configure the out-of-hours branch to:
    - Only escalate P1 alerts
    - Wait until working hours begin
    - Send to Slack channels instead of paging individuals
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between 'All at once' and adding multiple levels?">
    **All at once**: Notify everyone simultaneously, first acknowledgment stops escalation. Use for urgent parallel response.
    
    **Multiple levels**: Try each level sequentially with delays between. Use for hierarchical escalation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I manually trigger an escalation without an alert?">
    Yes. Use `/inc page` in Slack or select **Escalate to someone** from the dashboard. Useful for proactive escalations before declaring an incident.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long do escalations persist if no one acknowledges?">
    Escalations expire after exhausting all levels. Configure enough levels to ensure someone eventually responds. Consider adding a Slack channel as a final level.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I see escalation history and response times?">
    Yes. Navigate to **On-call → Escalations** to view all historical escalations, acknowledgment times, and which levels were reached.
