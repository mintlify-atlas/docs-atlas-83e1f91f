Escalation paths define how alerts reach responders through a series of levels with configurable timing and notification methods. Build escalation paths that try the right people in the right order with appropriate urgency.

## How escalation paths work

An escalation path consists of multiple levels that execute sequentially until someone acknowledges the alert:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Level 1 triggers">
    Alert routes to the escalation path and notifies all responders on level 1
  </Step>
  <Step title="Wait for acknowledgment">
    incident.io waits for the configured duration (e.g., 5 minutes) for someone to acknowledge
  </Step>
  <Step title="Escalate if needed">
    If no one acknowledges, escalate to level 2 and notify those responders
  </Step>
  <Step title="Continue escalating">
    Repeat through all levels until someone acknowledges or all levels are exhausted
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Escalation stops immediately when any responder acknowledges the alert at any level.
</Info>

## Create an escalation path

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to settings">
    Using the sidebar, navigate to **Settings → Escalation paths**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create new path">
    Click **+ Create escalation path** and give it a descriptive name
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add levels">
    Add one or more levels, choosing responders for each:
    - Specific users
    - Everyone on a [schedule](/product-documentation/on-call/schedules-overview)
    - Everyone on a [team](/product-documentation/on-call/teams)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure timing">
    Set how long to wait at each level before escalating (e.g., 5 minutes, 10 minutes)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set notification methods">
    Choose notification methods for each level (push, SMS, voice)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save and test">
    Save the escalation path and send a test alert to verify behavior
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Escalation levels

Each level in an escalation path can include multiple responders. All responders on a level are notified simultaneously when that level triggers.

### Who can be on a level

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Schedule">
    Notify whoever is currently on-call in a specific [schedule](/product-documentation/on-call/schedules-overview). This is the most common approach as it automatically adapts to rotation changes.
    
    **Example**: Level 1 notifies whoever is on the Platform team's primary schedule.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Specific users">
    Notify specific individuals directly. Use this for subject matter experts or managers who should always be notified at certain escalation levels.
    
    **Example**: Level 3 notifies the VP of Engineering directly.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Team">
    Notify all members of a [team](/product-documentation/on-call/teams) simultaneously. Use this for urgent issues that need immediate attention from anyone available.
    
    **Example**: Level 2 notifies everyone on the Security team for security incidents.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Escalation timing

Configure how long to wait at each level before escalating:

- **Short intervals (1-5 minutes)**: For critical alerts that need immediate attention
- **Medium intervals (5-15 minutes)**: Standard escalation timing for most alerts
- **Long intervals (15-30 minutes)**: For lower priority issues where responders may need time to investigate

<Tip>
Balance responsiveness with giving responders enough time to see and respond to notifications. Most teams start with 5-10 minute intervals.
</Tip>

## Notification methods

Configure how responders are notified at each escalation level:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Push notifications" icon="mobile">
    Via the [mobile app](/product-documentation/on-call/mobile-app-push-notifications)
  </Card>
  <Card title="SMS" icon="message">
    Text message to phone
  </Card>
  <Card title="Voice call" icon="phone">
    Automated voice call
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

You can configure different notification methods for different levels. Common patterns:

- **Level 1**: Push notification only
- **Level 2**: Push + SMS
- **Level 3**: Push + SMS + Voice call

This graduated approach balances urgency with notification fatigue.

Learn more about [SMS and voice notifications](/product-documentation/on-call/sms-and-voice) and [mobile app push notifications](/product-documentation/on-call/mobile-app-push-notifications).

## Priority-based escalation

Create different escalation paths for different alert priorities:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="P1 - Critical">
    Fast escalation with aggressive notifications:
    - **Level 1** (2 min): Primary on-call via push + SMS + voice
    - **Level 2** (3 min): Secondary on-call via push + SMS + voice
    - **Level 3** (5 min): Engineering manager via voice call
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="P2 - High">
    Standard escalation:
    - **Level 1** (10 min): Primary on-call via push
    - **Level 2** (15 min): Secondary on-call via push + SMS
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="P3 - Medium">
    Relaxed escalation:
    - **Level 1** (30 min): Primary on-call via push
    - **Level 2** (60 min): Team channel notification
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Escalation states

Escalations progress through different states:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Triggered** | Escalation has started and is actively notifying responders |
| **Acknowledged** | A responder has acknowledged and will handle the alert |
| **Cancelled** | The escalation was cancelled (alert resolved or manually stopped) |
| **Expired** | All escalation levels completed without acknowledgment |

<Warning>
When an escalation expires (all levels exhausted without acknowledgment), no further notifications are sent. Configure enough escalation levels to ensure critical alerts always reach someone.
</Warning>

## Advanced patterns

### Follow-the-sun escalation

Use multiple schedules in level 1 to ensure someone in an appropriate timezone responds:

- **Level 1**: US schedule + EU schedule + APAC schedule (whoever is in working hours)
- **Level 2**: All regional managers

### Round-robin attempts

Configure a level with multiple users to try them one at a time:

- **Level 1**: Try users A, B, C in sequence (30 seconds each)
- **Level 2**: Notify all three simultaneously

### Specialized escalation

Create escalation paths for specific types of alerts:

- **Database alerts**: DBA on-call → Database team → Infrastructure manager
- **Security alerts**: Security on-call → Security team → CISO
- **Customer-facing**: Support on-call → Support manager → Customer success

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with simple paths" icon="seedling">
    Begin with 2-3 levels: primary on-call, secondary on-call, manager. Add complexity as you learn what works for your team.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use schedules, not individuals" icon="calendar">
    Reference schedules in escalation levels rather than specific people. This keeps escalation paths working as team membership changes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Test your paths" icon="flask">
    Send test alerts through escalation paths regularly to verify timing, notifications, and responder awareness.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Balance urgency with fatigue" icon="balance-scale">
    Don't make every alert immediately trigger voice calls. Graduate notification intensity with escalation levels.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Have a final catch-all" icon="net">
    Ensure your final escalation level reaches someone who will definitely respond (e.g., entire team or manager).
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Enable auto-cancel" icon="circle-xmark">
    Configure escalation paths to automatically cancel when alerts are resolved, preventing unnecessary pages.
  </Accordion>

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens if everyone at a level is already on another alert?">
    Responders still receive notifications even if they're handling other alerts. They can acknowledge multiple alerts and prioritize based on severity.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I manually escalate an alert?">
    Yes. From the alert details page, you can manually trigger escalation to the next level or page specific people directly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if someone acknowledges an alert by mistake?">
    They can un-acknowledge the alert, which resumes the escalation from the current level.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do escalation paths interact with schedules?">
    When an escalation level references a schedule, it notifies whoever is currently on-call according to that schedule (including any [overrides](/product-documentation/on-call/overrides-and-cover-requests)).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I have different escalation paths for the same team?">
    Yes. Teams can have multiple escalation paths for different scenarios (e.g., business hours vs after hours, or P1 vs P2 alerts). Configure your [alert routes](/product-documentation/on-call/alert-routing) to choose the appropriate path based on conditions.
