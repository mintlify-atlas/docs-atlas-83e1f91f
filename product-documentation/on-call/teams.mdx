Teams in incident.io organize responders, schedules, and escalation paths by organizational structure. Use teams to automatically filter incidents and alerts, route pages to the right people, and maintain clear ownership of on-call responsibilities.

## Why use teams

Teams provide a consistent way to organize on-call across incident.io:

- **Automatic filtering**: View only incidents and alerts relevant to your teams
- **Dynamic routing**: Route alerts to teams automatically based on service ownership or other catalog relationships
- **Ownership clarity**: Link escalation paths and schedules to teams for clear responsibility
- **Simplified configuration**: Configure once using team attributes, not separate rules for each team

## Set up teams

Configure teams from **Settings → Teams** using the three-step setup wizard:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose a sync source">
    Select how you want to manage team membership:
    - Identity providers (Okta, Google Workspace, Microsoft Entra ID) via SCIM
    - Service catalogs (Backstage, Cortex, Linear, OpsLevel)
    - Slack user groups
    - Manual management in incident.io
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure team attributes">
    Add attributes like Slack channel, PagerDuty service, or custom fields for workflows and alert routing
  </Step>
  <Step title="Link teams to schedules and escalation paths">
    Associate existing or new schedules and escalation paths with teams
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
Using SCIM or another integration ensures team membership stays up to date automatically as people join, leave, or change teams.
</Tip>

## Manage team membership

Choose the approach that matches how you manage teams:

### Manually in incident.io

Add, remove, and manage team members directly from **Settings → Teams**. Best for small organizations or when team membership doesn't change frequently.

1. Navigate to **Settings → Teams**
2. Select a team or create a new one
3. Click **Manage members**
4. Add or remove users
5. Save changes

### With SCIM

Automatically sync teams and members from your identity provider. incident.io creates and updates teams based on groups in your IdP.

**Supported SCIM providers:**
- Okta
- Google Workspace
- Microsoft Entra ID (formerly Azure AD)
- OneLogin
- Any SCIM 2.0 compatible provider

See [Using SCIM to create a Team catalog type](/help-centre/catalog/catalog-best-practices/using-scim-to-create-a-team-catalog-type) for setup details.

### With service catalogs

Sync teams from service catalog platforms:

- **Backstage**: Import teams and ownership from Backstage catalog
- **Cortex**: Sync teams and service ownership
- **Linear**: Import teams from Linear workspace
- **OpsLevel**: Bring in teams and service relationships

Configure integrations from **Settings → Integrations**.

### With catalog-importer or Terraform

Manage teams as code using [catalog-importer](https://github.com/incident-io/catalog-importer) or the [incident.io Terraform provider](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/incident-io/incident/latest).

Best for organizations that manage infrastructure and organizational structure as code.

## Link teams to escalation paths

Connect teams to escalation paths to enable dynamic routing:

1. Navigate to **On-call → Escalation paths**
2. Create or edit an escalation path
3. Select **Teams** under "Owned by"
4. Choose the team(s) that own this escalation path
5. Save the escalation path

incident.io automatically creates a catalog relationship linking the team to the escalation path. Use this relationship in alert routes and workflows:

```
Alert > Team > Escalation paths
```

This expression routes alerts to whichever escalation path is linked to the alert's team attribute.

## Link teams to schedules

Associate schedules with teams for easy filtering and organization:

1. Navigate to **On-call → Schedules**
2. Create or edit a schedule
3. Select **Teams** under "Owned by"
4. Choose the team(s) that own this schedule
5. Save the schedule

Schedules and escalation paths owned by your teams appear at the top of lists for quick access.

## Team attributes for routing

Add attributes to teams to enable dynamic routing and automation:

| Common team attributes | Use case |
|----------------------|----------|
| **Slack channel** | Route alerts to team-specific channels using `Alert > Team > Slack channel` |
| **Email** | Send notifications to team distribution lists |
| **Escalation path** | Link default escalation path for the team (created automatically) |
| **PagerDuty service** | Map to external PagerDuty services |
| **Region** | Route based on geography for follow-the-sun support |

Add custom attributes from **Settings → Teams → Configure → Attributes**.

## Automatic filtering

By default, the dashboard filters incidents and alerts to show only those relevant to your teams.

### Configure filtering

Customize automatic filtering from **Settings → Teams → Configure**:

- **Incidents**: Choose which custom field determines team affiliation (default: "Affected teams")
- **Alerts**: Choose which attribute determines team affiliation (default: "Team")
- **Disable filtering**: Turn off automatic filtering if you want to see all incidents and alerts

### User preferences

Each user can control whether their dashboard filters by team from **Preferences → My dashboard**:

- **Filter by my teams**: Show only items related to teams you're a member of
- **Show everything**: Display all incidents and alerts regardless of team

<Tip>
Use ⌘+K (Ctrl+K on Windows) and search "preferences" to quickly access your preferences.
</Tip>

## Route alerts to teams

Use teams in alert routing expressions to automatically page the right people:

### Direct team routing

Route alerts directly to a team's escalation path:

```
Alert > Team > Escalation paths
```

### Service ownership routing

Route based on which team owns the affected service:

```
Alert > Service > Owner > Escalation paths
```

### Fallback routing

Provide fallbacks when team information is missing:

```
Alert > Service > Owner > Escalation paths || Infrastructure team escalation path
```

See [Alert routing](/product-documentation/on-call/alert-routing) for complete routing configuration.

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I change which teams I'm a member of?">
    If using SCIM or another sync source, update team membership in your identity provider or service catalog. Changes sync automatically.
    
    If managing teams manually, ask an admin to update membership from **Settings → Teams**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can one escalation path belong to multiple teams?">
    Yes. Link escalation paths to multiple teams if they're jointly owned. The escalation path appears for all linked teams.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I delete a team?">
    Deleting a team removes it from catalog relationships, but doesn't delete linked schedules or escalation paths. Update alert routes and workflows that reference the deleted team.
    
    Historical incidents and alerts retain the team information they had when created.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I nest teams hierarchically?">
    Not currently. Teams are flat in incident.io. However, you can create custom catalog types to represent organizational hierarchy (departments, divisions, etc.) and link teams to those.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I migrate to SCIM after starting with manual teams?">
    Run the team setup wizard again from **Settings → Teams → Configure**. Choose SCIM as your sync source. incident.io will guide you through mapping existing teams to SCIM groups.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why don't I see any teams in my escalation path configuration?">
    Ensure teams are created in **Settings → Teams** first. The team catalog type must exist before you can link it to schedules and escalation paths.
  </Accordion>
