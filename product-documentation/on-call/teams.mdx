Teams in incident.io help you organize on-call configuration and provide automatic filtering across the platform. When you define teams and their members, incident.io shows only the incidents, alerts, schedules, and escalation paths relevant to each team member.

## Why use teams

Teams enable several powerful capabilities:

- **Automatic filtering** - Team members see only incidents and alerts affecting their teams, reducing noise
- **Dynamic routing** - Route alerts to teams using catalog relationships without configuring each team separately
- **Ownership tracking** - Link escalation paths and schedules to teams to show ownership clearly
- **Scalable configuration** - Use team attributes in alert routes and workflows to avoid per-team configuration

## Creating teams

Set up teams using the three-step wizard in **Settings → Teams**:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Choose team source">
    Select how you want to manage team memberships:
    - **Sync from external system** - Use SCIM, Backstage, Cortex, Linear, Opslevel, or Slack
    - **Manage manually** - Create and manage teams directly in incident.io
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add teams">
    Import teams from your selected source or create them manually
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure attributes">
    Add optional attributes to teams (e.g., Slack channel, escalation path) for use in workflows and alert routing
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Syncing teams from external systems

Automate team management by syncing from identity providers, developer portals, or collaboration tools:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="SCIM (Okta, Google Workspace, Microsoft Entra ID)">
    Sync teams and their members from your identity provider using SCIM. Team memberships update automatically when you make changes in your IdP.
    
    See [Using SCIM to create a team catalog type](/help-centre/catalog/catalog-best-practices/using-scim-to-create-a-team-catalog-type) for setup instructions.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Backstage">
    Import teams and their relationships from Backstage's catalog. See [Backstage integration](/help-centre/catalog/catalog-integrations/backstage) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Other integrations">
    incident.io also syncs teams from:
    - Cortex
    - Linear
    - Opslevel
    - Slack user groups
    
    Configure these integrations in **Settings → Teams → Configure**.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Managing teams

Choose the management approach that fits your workflow:

### Manual management

For smaller organizations or to quickly get started:

1. Navigate to **Settings → Teams**
2. Create teams and add members directly
3. Link teams to schedules and escalation paths
4. Add custom attributes (Slack channel, email, etc.)

This approach works well for teams that change infrequently.

### SCIM or integration sync

For larger organizations or when team data exists elsewhere:

1. Configure SCIM or integration in **Settings → Teams → Configure**
2. Teams and members sync automatically from your source system
3. Link synced teams to schedules and escalation paths in incident.io
4. Add team members or change membership in your source system

You can manage team attributes and links to schedules/escalation paths in incident.io even when members are managed externally.

### Code-based management

For infrastructure-as-code workflows:

Use [catalog-importer](https://github.com/incident-io/catalog-importer) or [Terraform](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/incident-io/incident/latest) to manage teams alongside other catalog resources.

This approach works well when:
- Team definitions live in code repositories
- You want to version control team changes
- You manage relationships between teams, services, and infrastructure in code

## Automatic filtering

Once teams are configured, incident.io automatically filters views based on team membership:

### Incidents

By default, the incidents list shows only incidents affecting your teams (based on the "Affected teams" custom field). You can:
- Change the filtering behavior in **Settings → Teams → Configure**
- Temporarily view all incidents by clearing the team filter
- Set your default view in **Preferences → My dashboard**

### Alerts

The alerts list shows only alerts tagged with your teams (based on the "Team" attribute). Configure which attribute drives filtering in **Settings → Teams → Configure**.

### Schedules and escalation paths

Schedules and escalation paths owned by your teams appear at the top of lists, making it easy to find and manage your team's on-call configuration.

<Tip>
Access preferences quickly using the ⌘+K menu and searching "preferences".
</Tip>

## Linking teams to escalation and schedules

Connect teams to their on-call configuration:

1. When creating or editing a schedule or escalation path, select the owning team
2. The team relationship appears in the catalog automatically
3. Use catalog relationships in alert routing: `Alert > Service > Owner > Escalation paths`

<Info>
If you manage schedules or escalation paths with Terraform, set the `team_ids` attribute in your Terraform configuration. Team links managed via Terraform cannot be changed in the dashboard.
</Info>

## Routing alerts to teams

Use catalog relationships to route alerts dynamically:

### Direct team routing

Route alerts tagged with a team attribute:
```text
Alert > Team > Escalation paths
```text

This routes alerts directly to the escalation path linked to the affected team.

### Service-based routing

Route alerts based on the service's owning team:
```text
Alert > Service > Owner > Escalation paths
```text

This routes alerts to the team that owns the affected service, without requiring alerts to specify the team directly.

### Using team attributes

Send notifications to team-specific channels:
```text
Alert > Team > Slack channel
```text

Add a "Slack channel" attribute to your Team catalog type, then reference it in alert routes to send alerts to the right channel for each team.

## Team attributes for workflows

Add attributes to teams for use in workflows and alert routing:

**Common team attributes:**
- **Slack channel** - Post messages to team channels
- **Email** - Send notifications to team distribution lists
- **Region** - Route based on geographic location
- **Tier** - Different SLAs or escalation behavior by team tier

Add attributes in **Settings → Teams → Configure** or when creating teams.

## Best practices

### Start with core teams

Begin by creating teams that are directly involved in incident response. Add other teams later as you expand incident.io usage.

### Use SCIM when available

If you have an identity provider that supports SCIM, use it to keep team memberships automatically synchronized. This reduces manual maintenance.

### Model team relationships in catalog

Connect teams to the services they own, the features they maintain, and the infrastructure they manage. These relationships power dynamic alert routing.

### Add team attributes gradually

Start with basic team setup, then add attributes (Slack channels, escalation paths) as you build more sophisticated routing and automation.

### Review team filtering defaults

Ensure the default team filtering behavior matches your organization's needs. Adjust settings in **Settings → Teams → Configure** if needed.

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I be a member of multiple teams?">
    Yes. Users can be members of multiple teams. When team filtering is enabled, you'll see incidents and alerts affecting any of your teams.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I disable team filtering?">
    Go to **Preferences → My dashboard** and change your default view from "My teams" to "All". You can also temporarily disable filtering by clearing the team filter on incidents or alerts pages.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I link one schedule to multiple teams?">
    Yes. A schedule or escalation path can be linked to multiple teams. This is useful for shared on-call rotation across teams.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I switch from manual to SCIM management?">
    Run the team setup wizard again from **Settings → Teams → Configure**. Select SCIM as your source and map SCIM groups to existing teams. Team memberships will sync from SCIM going forward, but links to schedules and escalation paths are preserved.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to use teams?">
    No. Teams are optional. However, they provide significant benefits for organizations with multiple teams or complex alert routing needs. You can start without teams and add them later.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I manage some teams manually and sync others from SCIM?">
    No. Choose one management method for all teams. However, you can manage team attributes and links to schedules/escalation paths in incident.io even when members are synced from external systems.
