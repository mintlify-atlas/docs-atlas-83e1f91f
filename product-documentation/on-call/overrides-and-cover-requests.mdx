description: Manage schedule overrides and cover requests

Overrides and cover requests provide flexibility for temporary changes to on-call schedules without modifying the underlying rotation configuration. Use these features to handle planned absences, emergency coverage needs, and shift swaps.

## Overrides

Overrides temporarily replace a scheduled responder with another person for a specific time window. Create overrides for:

- Planned time off (vacation, appointments, holidays)
- Emergency situations requiring immediate coverage changes
- Temporary shift swaps between team members

Overrides apply immediately and expire automatically when the time window ends. The original schedule resumes without any permanent changes.

### Create an override

#### From the dashboard

Create overrides from **On-call → Schedules**:

1. Navigate to the schedule you want to override
2. Choose one of three methods:
   - Click **Create an override** from the top right
   - Click on a specific shift you want to override
   - Drag and drop to select a portion of a shift
3. Select the person to provide coverage
4. Adjust the time window if needed
5. Optionally add a note explaining the override
6. Click **Create override**

<Tip>
Drag and drop on the schedule timeline to quickly create overrides for specific time ranges.
</Tip>

#### From the mobile app

Create overrides directly from the incident.io mobile app:

1. Open the app and navigate to **Schedules** (calendar icon)
2. Select the schedule
3. Either:
   - Tap the top right icon and select **Create override**
   - Drag and drop on a shift to select the time range
4. Choose the replacement responder
5. Adjust the time window
6. Add an optional note
7. Tap **Create**

### Edit or delete an override

**Dashboard**: Click on the overridden shift and select **Edit** or **Delete** from the tooltip.

**Mobile app**: Tap an overridden shift, then select **Edit** or **Delete**.

<Info>
Deleting an override immediately restores the original scheduled responder.
</Info>

### Override behavior

When an override is active:

- The replacement responder appears in the schedule
- Escalations route to the override responder, not the original responder
- The override responder receives shift change notifications
- Overrides appear visually distinct in the schedule (shaded or marked)
- [Compensation tracking](/product-documentation/on-call/compensation-calculator) attributes on-call hours to the override responder

## Cover requests

Cover requests let you ask teammates to cover your shift. The system notifies everyone in the schedule, and the first person to accept automatically creates an override.

Use cover requests when:

- You need coverage but don't know who's available
- You want to give multiple people the opportunity to volunteer
- You prefer teammates to opt-in rather than being assigned

### Request cover

#### From Slack

Use the `/inc cover me` command in any channel where the incident.io bot is present:

1. Type `/inc cover me` and press Enter
2. Select the schedule and time range you need covered
3. Add a message explaining why you need cover (e.g., "Doctor appointment")
4. Click **Send request**

All members of the schedule receive a notification with the details and an **Accept** button.

#### From the mobile app

Request cover from the Schedules view:

1. Open the incident.io mobile app
2. Navigate to **Schedules** (calendar icon)
3. Either:
   - Tap the top right icon and select **Request cover**
   - Tap your shift and drag to select the time range
4. Add a message explaining your request
5. Tap **Send request**

#### From the dashboard

Request cover from **On-call → Schedules**:

1. Navigate to your schedule
2. Click **Request cover** from the top right
3. Select your shift and time range
4. Add a message
5. Click **Send request**

### Respond to cover requests

When someone requests cover, all schedule members receive a notification:

**In Slack**: Click **Accept** on the cover request message to volunteer.

**In the mobile app**: Navigate to **Schedules** → **Cover requests** and tap **Accept** on a request.

**In the dashboard**: Navigate to **On-call → Schedules** → **Cover requests** and click **Accept**.

You can offer to cover some or all of the requested time. Add a message when accepting if you want to provide additional context.

<Info>
Once someone accepts a cover request, the system creates an override automatically and notifies both parties. The request closes and other responders can no longer accept it.
</Info>

### Manage cover requests

#### View open requests

See all open cover requests from:

- **Dashboard**: **On-call → Schedules** → **Cover requests** tab
- **Mobile app**: **Schedules** → top right icon → **Cover requests**

Filter requests by schedule, date range, or status (open, accepted, expired).

#### Send reminders

If no one has responded to your cover request, send a reminder:

1. Navigate to your open cover request
2. Click **Send reminder**
3. A push notification goes to all schedule members who haven't responded

#### Cancel a request

Cancel your cover request if you no longer need coverage:

1. Navigate to your open cover request
2. Click **Cancel request**
3. All notified responders receive a cancellation message

### Partial coverage

When accepting a cover request, you can offer to cover only part of the requested time:

1. Click **Accept** on the cover request
2. Adjust the start and end times
3. Add a message like "I can cover until 3pm"
4. Submit your acceptance

The original requester receives a notification and can accept the partial coverage or continue seeking coverage for the remaining time.

## Permissions

**Who can create overrides:**
- Schedule owners and editors
- Organization admins
- Anyone with schedule edit permissions

**Who can request cover:**
- Only the person scheduled for a shift can request cover for that shift
- You cannot request cover on behalf of someone else
- Workaround: Create an override to assign yourself to the shift, then request cover

**Who can accept cover requests:**
- Any member of the schedule
- People explicitly invited to the cover request

## Best practices

### Plan ahead

Request cover as early as possible for planned time off. Last-minute requests are harder to fill.

### Be specific

Include context in cover requests: "Doctor appointment" or "Family emergency" helps teammates understand urgency.

### Override vs. cover request

- Use **overrides** when you know who will cover (e.g., arranged with a specific colleague)
- Use **cover requests** when you need someone to volunteer (e.g., unexpected absence)

### Communicate coverage gaps

If a cover request isn't accepted, notify your manager or escalation path owner to arrange mandatory coverage.

### Review overrides regularly

Check scheduled overrides weekly to catch mistakes or outdated coverage arrangements.

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I create an override for someone else's shift?">
    Yes, if you have edit permissions on the schedule. However, you cannot request cover on someone else's behalf - only for your own shifts.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if multiple people accept a cover request?">
    The first person to accept creates the override. incident.io automatically closes the request and notifies other responders that coverage has been arranged.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do overrides affect compensation tracking?">
    Yes. On-call hours during an override are attributed to the override responder, not the originally scheduled person. See [Compensation calculator](/product-documentation/on-call/compensation-calculator) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I see historical overrides?">
    Yes. View past overrides by navigating to **On-call → Schedules**, selecting a schedule, and adjusting the timeline to past dates. Historical overrides appear in the schedule visualization.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How far in advance can I create an override?">
    Overrides can be created as far into the future as the schedule is configured. There's no limit on advance override creation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I delete an override that's currently active?">
    Deleting an active override immediately transfers responsibility back to the originally scheduled responder. They'll receive a notification and any subsequent escalations will route to them.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I create recurring overrides?">
    Not currently. Each override must be created individually. For recurring changes, consider updating the schedule rotation instead.
  </Accordion>
