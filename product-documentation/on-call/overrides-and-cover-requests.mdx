title: Overrides and cover requests
description: Handle temporary schedule changes and request cover for shifts
---

Overrides and cover requests provide flexible ways to handle temporary schedule changes without permanently modifying rotation configuration. Use these features to manage planned absences, handle unexpected conflicts, and ensure continuous coverage.

## Overrides

Overrides temporarily replace scheduled responders for specific time windows. They expire automatically when the time window ends, leaving the underlying schedule unchanged.

### When to use overrides

- **Planned absences** - Holidays, vacation, or time off
- **Appointments** - Medical appointments, meetings, or personal commitments during on-call shifts
- **Team changes** - Temporarily adjusting coverage while onboarding new team members
- **Load balancing** - Redistributing on-call burden when someone has been paged frequently

### Creating overrides

Create overrides from the dashboard or mobile app:

#### Dashboard

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to schedule">
    Open the schedule in **On-call → Schedules**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create override">
    Click **Create an override** from the top right, or click on a specific shift, or drag and drop to select a portion of a shift
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure details">
    - Select the person to override (original scheduled responder)
    - Select the replacement responder
    - Set the start and end time for the override
    - Add an optional note explaining the override
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save override">
    Click **Save** to create the override
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### Mobile app

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open schedules">
    Navigate to the **Schedules** tab (calendar icon) in the mobile app
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select method">
    Either:
    - Tap the top right icon and select **Create override**
    - Drag and drop on the schedule to select the time window
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure and save">
    Select responders, set time window, and save
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Managing overrides

**Edit overrides:**
- Dashboard: Click on an overridden shift and modify details
- Mobile app: Tap an overridden shift and select **Edit**

**Delete overrides:**
- Dashboard: Click on an overridden shift and select **Delete**, or use the delete option from the tooltip
- Mobile app: Tap an overridden shift and select **Delete**

<Info>
Overrides appear visually distinct on schedules (typically with a different color or pattern) to differentiate them from regular shifts.
</Info>

## Cover requests

Cover requests allow responders to ask others in their schedule to take over shifts. When someone accepts a cover request, an override is created automatically.

### When to use cover requests

- **Requesting time off** - Ask teammates to cover your shift
- **Partial shift coverage** - Request cover for just a portion of your shift (e.g., during an appointment)
- **Distributing coverage** - Let the team decide who's available to cover

### Creating cover requests

Request cover via Slack, the mobile app, or the dashboard:

#### Slack

<Steps>
  <Step title="Use command">
    Type `/inc cover me` in any channel where the incident.io bot is present
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select shift">
    Choose which shift you need covered
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add details">
    Provide context about why you need cover (optional but helpful)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit request">
    Send the request to your team
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### Mobile app

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open schedules">
    Navigate to the **Schedules** tab in the mobile app
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select method">
    Either:
    - Tap the top right icon and select **Request cover**
    - Tap a shift and drag to select the portion you need covered
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add context">
    Explain why you need cover (helps teammates decide whether to accept)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Submit request">
    Send the request
  </Step>
</Steps>

#### Dashboard

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to schedule">
    Open the schedule in **On-call → Schedules**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create request">
    Click **Request cover** from the schedule view
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure and submit">
    Select the time window, add context, and submit
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
You can only request cover for shifts you're personally scheduled for. You cannot request cover on behalf of other users (regardless of your role). 

**Workaround:** Add yourself as an override to the slot first, then create a cover request.
</Warning>

### Responding to cover requests

When someone requests cover, all people in the schedule receive notifications:

**In mobile app:**
- You'll see the cover request notification
- View request details including the time window and reason
- **Offer to cover** - Accept the full requested time or offer to cover a portion
- Add a message when offering to cover (optional)

**In dashboard:**
- View cover requests in the schedule view
- Offer to cover some or all of the requested time
- Add a message to coordinate with the requester

**When someone accepts:**
- The requester receives a confirmation notification
- An override is created automatically
- Other team members are notified that the request has been fulfilled
- The cover request is marked as complete

### Managing cover requests

**Send reminders:**
- Open cover requests show a **Send reminder** option
- Sends push notifications to team members who haven't responded yet
- Useful when your shift is approaching and you still need coverage

**Cancel cover requests:**
- If your plans change and you no longer need cover
- Navigate to the cover request and select **Cancel**

## Syncing with calendars

When you sync schedules to Google Calendar or Outlook, overrides appear automatically in your calendar:

- **Original shifts** are removed or updated when overridden
- **New shifts** appear when you accept cover for someone else
- Calendar events stay in sync as overrides are created, edited, or deleted

## Best practices

### Request cover early

Request cover as soon as you know you'll need it. This gives teammates time to review and accept requests.

### Provide context

When requesting cover, explain why you need it and whether it's flexible. Context helps teammates decide whether they can help.

### Use partial overrides

If you only need a few hours covered (e.g., during an appointment), create an override for just that portion rather than the entire shift.

### Review cover requests regularly

Check for cover requests from teammates. Being responsive helps maintain team coverage and builds reciprocity.

### Plan for holidays

Create overrides well in advance for known holidays and vacation periods. Don't rely on last-minute cover requests for planned time off.

### Monitor override frequency

If you're creating many overrides, consider whether the schedule rotation needs adjustment. Frequent overrides may indicate scheduling issues.

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do overrides affect historical data?">
    No. Overrides only change who is on-call for the specified time window. They don't modify the underlying schedule configuration or affect historical records.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I create an override for someone else's shift?">
    Yes. Anyone with edit permissions for a schedule can create overrides for any shift, including replacing one responder with another.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I create overlapping overrides?">
    The most recently created override takes precedence for overlapping time windows. incident.io shows warnings when you create overlapping overrides.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I request cover from people outside my schedule?">
    No. Cover requests are sent to all people in the schedule. To involve someone outside the schedule, create an override directly.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if nobody accepts my cover request?">
    If no one accepts your cover request, you remain scheduled for that shift. Consider:
    - Sending a reminder to the team

    - Creating an override directly if you've arranged coverage outside the system
    - Escalating to your manager if this is for mandatory time off
  </Accordion>
