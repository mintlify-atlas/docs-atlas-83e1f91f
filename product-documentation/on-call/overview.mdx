## Key features

### Intelligent alert management

- **Dynamic routing**: Route alerts automatically based on catalog relationships and attributes
- **Deduplication**: Prevent duplicate alerts from creating noise
- **Grouping**: Combine related alerts into single incidents for efficient triage
- **Auto-resolution**: Resolve alerts automatically when monitoring tools send clear signals

### Flexible notification options

Reach responders through multiple channels:
