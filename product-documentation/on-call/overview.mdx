incident.io's on-call capabilities eliminate manual coordination about who responds to alerts at any moment. The platform connects your monitoring tools to on-call teams through intelligent routing, ensuring critical issues reach the right responders automatically.

## Core capabilities

On-call management in incident.io brings together multiple capabilities into a unified workflow:

## How on-call works

The on-call workflow follows a clear path from alert detection to resolution:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Alerts arrive from sources">
    Monitoring tools, error trackers, and other systems send alerts through [alert sources](/product-documentation/on-call/alert-sources). Native integrations, HTTP endpoints, and email addresses bring issues into incident.io.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Attributes provide context">
    [Alert attributes](/product-documentation/on-call/alert-attributes) extract structured data from alert payloads—like team, service, or priority—enabling intelligent routing and providing responders with critical context.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Routes determine actions">
    [Alert routes](/product-documentation/on-call/alert-routing) filter alerts, trigger escalations, create incidents, and send notifications to Slack or Microsoft Teams based on alert context.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Schedules resolve who responds">
    [Schedules](/product-documentation/on-call/schedules-overview) determine who is on-call at any moment, with support for rotations, working hours, and follow-the-sun coverage.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Escalations notify responders">
    [Escalation paths](/product-documentation/on-call/escalation-paths) page on-call responders through multiple notification channels, with automatic escalation when responses aren't acknowledged.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Responders take action">
    Responders receive notifications via [mobile app](/product-documentation/on-call/mobile-app-push-notifications), [SMS, or voice](/product-documentation/on-call/sms-and-voice), acknowledge alerts, and resolve issues.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Key features

### Dynamic routing with catalog

Use your [Catalog](/product-documentation/catalog) to power intelligent alert routing. Instead of maintaining separate configurations for each team or service, routes automatically follow relationships in your catalog. When a service's owning team changes, routing updates automatically.

### Flexible notification channels

Reach responders through multiple channels based on urgency and preferences:
- **Mobile app push notifications** with critical alerts that bypass Do Not Disturb
- **SMS and voice calls** for immediate escalation
- **Email** for lower-priority notifications
- **Slack and Microsoft Teams** for team visibility

### Live call routing

[Live call routing](/product-documentation/on-call/live-call-routing) provides phone numbers that external stakeholders can call to reach on-call teams directly. Calls follow escalation logic and create alerts for tracking.

### Compensation tracking

The [compensation calculator](/product-documentation/on-call/compensation-calculator) tracks on-call hours across schedules and generates pay reports with configurable rates for different regions, roles, or tiers.

## Getting started

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect alert sources">
    Start by connecting your monitoring tools in **Settings → Alerts**. Set up native integrations, HTTP endpoints, or email addresses to receive alerts.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define alert attributes">
    Configure attributes in **Settings → Alerts → Attributes** to extract structured data like team, service, and priority from alert payloads.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create schedules">
    Build schedules in **On-call → Schedules** to define who is on-call and when, with support for rotations and working hours.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure escalation paths">
    Set up escalation paths that reference schedules or specific users, with multiple levels to ensure responses.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build alert routes">
    Create alert routes in **Settings → Alerts → Routes** that filter alerts, trigger escalations, and create incidents based on alert context.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Teams and permissions

[Teams](/product-documentation/on-call/teams) organize on-call configuration and provide automatic filtering. Team members see incidents, alerts, schedules, and escalation paths relevant to their teams, reducing noise and improving focus.

Link teams to escalation paths and schedules to automatically route alerts based on team ownership. When team membership changes, routing stays in sync through catalog relationships.

<Info>
Sync team memberships from identity providers like Okta, Google Workspace, or Microsoft Entra ID using SCIM to keep teams automatically updated.

## Best practices

### Start simple, scale gradually

Begin with basic schedules and escalation paths for your most critical services. Add complexity—like follow-the-sun coverage or dynamic routing—as your organization's needs grow.

### Use catalog relationships

Model relationships between teams, services, and escalation paths in your catalog. This approach reduces configuration overhead and ensures routing stays current as ownership changes.

### Test before deploying

Use test alerts during setup to verify routing logic without spamming teams. Create test alert routes that decline or silence alerts while validating configuration.

### Monitor alert quality

Track alert patterns using the alerts dashboard to identify noisy sources, tune routing rules, and improve signal-to-noise ratio over time.

### Plan for coverage gaps

Use [overrides and cover requests](/product-documentation/on-call/overrides-and-cover-requests) to handle planned absences. Encourage team members to request cover in advance for holidays or appointments.
