## How on-call works

On-call management in incident.io follows a clear flow from alert ingestion to resolution:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ingest alerts">
    Connect your monitoring tools via [alert sources](/product-documentation/on-call/alert-sources) to bring alerts into incident.io
  </Step>
  <Step title="Extract context">
    Use [alert attributes](/product-documentation/on-call/alert-attributes) to extract structured data like team, service, and priority
  </Step>
  <Step title="Route intelligently">
    Configure [alert routes](/product-documentation/on-call/alert-routing) to filter, escalate, create incidents, and notify channels
  </Step>
  <Step title="Escalate to responders">
    Alerts follow [escalation paths](/product-documentation/on-call/escalation-paths) to reach on-call responders via push notifications, SMS, or voice
  </Step>
  <Step title="Respond and resolve">
    Responders acknowledge alerts, investigate issues, and mark alerts as resolved
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Getting started

New to on-call in incident.io? Start with these steps:

1. **Set up your first alert source** - Connect a monitoring tool to start receiving alerts
2. **Define alert attributes** - Extract key context like team and service from your alerts
3. **Create schedules** - Define who is on-call and when
4. **Configure escalation paths** - Set up how alerts should reach your teams
5. **Build alert routes** - Create rules to route alerts and create incidents

<Tip>
Start simple with one team and one alert source. You can add complexity as you learn the system.

## Common workflows

### Follow-the-sun coverage

Support teams across multiple timezones by configuring schedules with different working hours for each region. Use multiple rotations within a single schedule to ensure 24/7 coverage.

### Dynamic routing by service

Use catalog-powered alert attributes to automatically route alerts to the team that owns the affected service. When ownership changes in your catalog, routing updates automatically.

### Graduated escalations

Create escalation paths with multiple levels that wait before escalating further. This ensures urgent issues reach senior engineers while allowing time for initial responders to acknowledge.
