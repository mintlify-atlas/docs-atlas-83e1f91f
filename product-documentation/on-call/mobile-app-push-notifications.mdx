## What you receive in push notifications

When an alert is routed to you through an [escalation path](/product-documentation/on-call/escalation-paths), the push notification includes:

- Alert title and priority
- Key [alert attributes](/product-documentation/on-call/alert-attributes) like team, service, and customer
- Alert source (which monitoring tool triggered it)
- Time the alert was created
- Quick actions to acknowledge or view details

<Tip>
Tap the notification to open the full alert details in the mobile app, where you can take additional actions.

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need to keep the app open to receive notifications?">
    No. Push notifications work even when the app is closed, as long as it's installed and you're signed in.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use the mobile app without being on-call?">
    Yes. The mobile app provides access to all incidents, alerts, and schedules whether you're on-call or not. You'll only receive push notifications when alerts are routed to you.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if my phone is off?">
    If your phone is powered off when an alert fires, the notification will be delivered when your device turns back on. Configure your escalation path to escalate to other team members or notification methods if you don't acknowledge within a certain timeframe.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I customize which alerts send push notifications?">
    Notification routing is controlled by [alert routes](/product-documentation/on-call/alert-routing) and [escalation paths](/product-documentation/on-call/escalation-paths), not by individual user settings. Work with your team to configure appropriate routing logic.
