The incident.io mobile app provides the richest notification experience for on-call responders, with critical alerts that bypass Do Not Disturb mode, full alert context, and quick actions to acknowledge or resolve alerts.

## Critical notifications

Critical notifications are a special type of push notification that:
- **Bypass Do Not Disturb mode** - Alerts reach you even when your phone is silenced
- **Use distinct sounds** - Unique alert tones help you distinguish on-call notifications from other app notifications
- **Display prominently** - Critical alerts appear on your lock screen and banner notifications
- **Repeat if not acknowledged** - Follow escalation rules to ensure you see the notification

<Warning>
Enable critical notifications during onboarding to ensure you never miss an escalation. This is the most reliable way to receive on-call alerts.
</Warning>

## Notification preferences

Customize notification behavior in the mobile app or dashboard:

### Escalation notifications

Configure how you're notified when alerts are escalated to you:
- **Immediate push notification** - Receive notification as soon as you're escalated
- **Progressive notifications** - Set up multiple notification attempts with delays
- **Notification channels** - Combine mobile app push with SMS and voice for redundancy

### Shift change reminders

Stay aware of your on-call schedule with shift change notifications:
- **Before shift starts** - Reminder before your shift begins (configurable timing)
- **When shift starts** - Notification when you go on-call
- **Before shift ends** - Reminder before your shift concludes

Configure shift change rules in **Preferences** to ensure you're always prepared for your on-call shifts.

## Work profile support (Android)

If you use a work profile on Android, you can install the incident.io app in either your personal or work profile. Both installations work equally well for on-call notifications.

Install in your personal profile if you want to receive on-call notifications outside work hours without needing your work profile active.

## App appearance

Customize the mobile app's appearance:
- **Light mode** - Use light theme
- **Dark mode** - Use dark theme
- **Follow device theme** - Match your device's system theme

Change appearance settings in the mobile app's settings screen.

## Testing notifications

After setting up the mobile app and notification preferences:

1. Navigate to the settings screen in the mobile app
2. Tap **Test notifications**
3. Verify you receive a test push notification
4. Confirm critical notification features work (sound, banner, bypassing Do Not Disturb)

<Warning>
If test notifications don't arrive, check notification permissions in your device settings and ensure the app is allowed to send critical notifications.
</Warning>

## Best practices

### Complete full onboarding

Don't skip steps during the onboarding flow. Each step ensures critical notifications work reliably:
- Push notifications provide instant delivery
- Critical notifications bypass Do Not Disturb
- Contact card enables voice call bypass
- Phone verification enables SMS and voice fallback

### Test before your first shift

Test all notification channels before your first on-call shift. Verify:
- Push notifications arrive promptly
- Critical notifications bypass Do Not Disturb
- Sound and vibration work as expected
- You can acknowledge and resolve alerts from notifications

### Keep the app updated

Regularly update the mobile app to get the latest features, performance improvements, and bug fixes.

### Enable multiple notification channels

Configure both mobile app push notifications and SMS/voice as backup channels. This provides redundancy if one channel fails.

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Why am I not receiving push notifications?">
    Common issues:
    - Notification permissions not granted (check device settings)
    - Critical notifications not enabled (required for bypassing Do Not Disturb)
    - Battery optimization preventing notifications (disable for incident.io app)
    - App not running in background (ensure it's not force-closed)
    
    Use the test notification feature to diagnose the issue.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I disable critical notifications temporarily?">
    You can disable critical notifications in your device's app notification settings. However, this means you may miss escalations during Do Not Disturb mode. Consider using overrides or cover requests instead if you need time off from on-call duties.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use the app without enabling critical notifications?">
    Yes, but you may miss escalations when your phone is in Do Not Disturb mode. Critical notifications are strongly recommended for on-call responders.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I need to keep the app open to receive notifications?">
    No. The app doesn't need to be open or running in the foreground to receive notifications. Push notifications work even when the app is closed, as long as it's installed and notification permissions are granted.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I customize notification sounds?">
    Critical notification sounds are controlled by your device's system settings. You can customize notification sounds for the incident.io app in your device's notification settings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I uninstall and reinstall the app?">
    You'll need to complete the onboarding flow again to re-enable notifications. Your on-call schedule and alert preferences are stored on incident.io's servers, so they'll sync automatically when you sign in.
