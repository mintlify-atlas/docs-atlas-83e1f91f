## Critical notifications (iOS)

iOS critical notifications override Do Not Disturb, Focus modes, and the mute switch. incident.io uses critical notifications for high-urgency escalations.

**To enable critical notifications on iOS:**

1. Open the incident.io app
2. Go to **Settings** (gear icon)
3. Tap **Notifications**
4. Enable **Critical Alerts**
5. Grant permission when iOS prompts you

<Warning>
iOS requires explicit permission for critical notifications. Grant this permission to ensure you receive urgent alerts even when your phone is silenced.
</Warning>

## Configure Do Not Disturb bypass

### iOS

Allow incident.io notifications to bypass Do Not Disturb and Focus modes:

1. Open iOS **Settings**
2. Navigate to **Focus**
3. Select each Focus mode (Do Not Disturb, Sleep, Work, etc.)
4. Tap **Apps**
5. Under **Allowed Apps**, add **incident.io**
6. Repeat for all Focus modes

Additionally, add incident.io phone numbers to your Favorites to ensure voice calls bypass Focus modes.

### Android

Allow incident.io notifications as exceptions to Do Not Disturb:

1. Open Android **Settings**
2. Navigate to **Notifications** → **Do Not Disturb**
3. Tap **Apps**
4. Find and enable **incident.io**
5. Grant override permissions when prompted

Android may also require configuring notification channels to ensure on-call notifications are set as high priority.

## Notification types

The mobile app sends different notification types based on urgency:

| Notification type | When it's used | Behavior |
|------------------|----------------|----------|
| **Critical push** | High-urgency escalations | Bypasses Do Not Disturb, plays custom alert sound, displayed prominently |
| **Standard push** | Low-urgency escalations, shift reminders | Respects Do Not Disturb settings, uses default notification sound |
| **Silent push** | Background updates | Updates app data without alerting, no sound or vibration |

## Test notifications

Test your notification setup to verify everything works correctly:

1. Open the incident.io mobile app
2. Navigate to **Settings** → **Notifications**
3. Tap **Test notifications**
4. Select notification types to test
5. Verify you receive each notification type

<Tip>
Test notifications with your phone in Do Not Disturb mode to ensure critical alerts bypass silence settings.
