SMS and voice call notifications ensure critical alerts reach on-call responders through direct phone-based communication channels. Configure these notification methods to guarantee responders receive urgent pages even when they're away from their devices or the mobile app.

## Configure SMS and voice notifications

Set up SMS and voice call notifications from your user preferences:

1. Click your profile and select **Preferences**
2. Navigate to **On-call notifications**
3. Add your phone number under **Contact methods**
4. Configure notification rules for when you should receive SMS or voice calls

<Tip>
Verify your phone number by entering the confirmation code sent via SMS during setup.
</Tip>

## Notification preferences

Customize when and how you receive SMS and voice notifications:

### Contact methods

Add and verify your phone number to enable SMS and voice notifications. You can add multiple phone numbers if needed, such as a mobile phone and a desk phone.

### Notification rules

Configure up to 10 levels of incrementally delayed notifications. For example:

- **Immediate**: Mobile app push notification
- **After 2 minutes**: SMS notification
- **After 5 minutes**: Voice call
- **After 10 minutes**: Voice call (repeated)

Create different notification strategies for high-urgency vs. low-urgency escalations based on priority or working hours.

### High-urgency vs. low-urgency

Escalation paths can specify urgency levels for each escalation level. Configure separate notification preferences for each:

- **High-urgency**: Aggressive notification strategy with voice calls starting immediately or after short delays
- **Low-urgency**: Gentler notification strategy starting with push notifications and email

## Voice call behavior

When you receive a voice call notification:

1. Your phone rings with a call from the incident.io notification number
2. An automated message describes the alert (title, priority, affected service)
3. Press **1** to acknowledge the escalation
4. Press **2** to hear the alert details again
5. Press **3** to ignore this notification (escalation continues)

<Warning>
Add the incident.io notification number to your phone's do-not-disturb bypass list to ensure you receive critical calls.
</Warning>

## SMS message format

SMS notifications include:

- Alert title
- Priority level
- Key alert attributes (team, service, customer)
- Link to view full alert details
- Instructions to acknowledge

Respond to SMS notifications by clicking the link to open the mobile app or dashboard.

## Testing notifications

Test your SMS and voice notification setup before going on-call:

1. Navigate to **Preferences → On-call notifications**
2. Click **Test** next to your notification rules
3. Select notification types to test (SMS, voice, or both)
4. Verify you receive notifications as expected

<Info>
Test notifications don't create real alerts or trigger escalations. They only verify your notification delivery paths.

## Best practices

### Multiple notification channels

Configure multiple notification methods (push, SMS, voice) with increasing urgency. Don't rely solely on one channel.

### Save incident.io contact numbers

Add notification numbers to your phone contacts as "incident.io Alerts" so you recognize incoming calls.

### Configure Do Not Disturb bypass

Set up your phone to allow calls and SMS from incident.io numbers even during Do Not Disturb or silent modes.

### Verify regularly

Test your notification setup monthly or whenever you change phone numbers or devices.

### Use shift reminders

Enable shift change notifications to receive reminders before your on-call shift begins, giving you time to verify your phone is configured correctly.
