SMS and voice call notifications ensure critical alerts reach on-call responders even when they're away from their computers or mobile apps. Configure these notification methods as part of your escalation paths to provide reliable fallback options for urgent issues.

## How SMS and voice notifications work

When an alert triggers an escalation path, incident.io can notify responders through multiple channels in sequence:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Mobile push notification">
    First attempt via the incident.io mobile app
  </Step>
  <Step title="SMS message">
    If configured, send an SMS with alert details
  </Step>
  <Step title="Voice call">
    If configured, place a voice call to read alert information
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Configure notification methods and timing in your [escalation paths](/product-documentation/on-call/escalation-paths).
</Info>

## SMS notifications

SMS notifications deliver alert details as text messages to responders' phone numbers. Each SMS includes:

- Alert title and description
- Key [alert attributes](/product-documentation/on-call/alert-attributes) like priority, team, and service
- Link to view full alert details in the dashboard
- Instructions for acknowledging or resolving the alert

### Configure SMS notifications

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add phone number">
    Each user must add their phone number in their profile settings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure escalation path">
    In your escalation path settings, enable SMS as a notification method
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set timing">
    Define how long to wait before sending SMS (e.g., send immediately, or after 2 minutes if mobile push is not acknowledged)
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
Ensure phone numbers include country codes for international delivery.
</Warning>

## Voice call notifications

Voice calls provide the most intrusive notification method for critical alerts. When a responder receives a voice call:

1. Their phone rings from the incident.io call system
2. An automated voice reads the alert title, priority, and key details
3. The responder can press buttons to acknowledge or get more information
4. Call continues until acknowledged or times out

### Configure voice notifications

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add phone number">
    Each user must add their phone number in their profile settings
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure escalation path">
    In your escalation path settings, enable voice calls as a notification method
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set timing">
    Define when to escalate to voice (e.g., after mobile push and SMS are not acknowledged for 5 minutes)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Voice call actions

During a voice call, responders can take actions using their phone keypad:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| **1** | Acknowledge the alert |
| **2** | Hear alert details again |
| **3** | Get incident information |
| **9** | End the call |

<Tip>
Add your incident.io voice number to your phone's contacts so you recognize critical alerts immediately.

  <Accordion title="Test your setup" icon="flask">
    Send test alerts to verify SMS and voice notifications reach responders correctly before going live.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Set do-not-disturb bypass" icon="moon">
    Add incident.io's phone numbers to your device's do-not-disturb bypass list to ensure voice calls come through.
  </Accordion>
