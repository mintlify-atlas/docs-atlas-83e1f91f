SMS and voice call notifications ensure critical alerts reach on-call responders even when they're away from their devices or in situations where mobile app notifications might be missed.

</Steps>

## Notification preferences

Customize when and how you receive SMS and voice notifications:

- **Immediate notifications**: Receive SMS or voice calls immediately when escalated
- **Delayed notifications**: Configure delays between notification attempts (useful for progressive escalation)
- **Multiple notification levels**: Set up to 10 levels of incrementally delayed notifications

You can configure different notification rules for different scenarios, such as:
- High-priority alerts trigger immediate voice calls
- Medium-priority alerts start with SMS, then escalate to voice calls if not acknowledged
- Low-priority alerts use mobile app notifications only

## Voice call behavior

When you receive a voice call escalation:

1. Your phone rings from the incident.io phone number
2. Answer the call to hear alert details read aloud
3. Follow voice prompts to acknowledge or escalate the alert
4. The system confirms your action before ending the call

<Tip>
Add incident.io's phone number to your phone's do-not-disturb bypass list to ensure you receive critical escalation calls even during quiet hours.
</Tip>

## SMS notification format

SMS notifications include:
- Alert title and description
- Priority level
- Key alert attributes (team, service, customer)
- Link to view full alert details in the dashboard or mobile app

## Supported countries

SMS and voice notifications are available in most countries worldwide. Contact support if you experience issues receiving notifications in your region.

<Info>
Phone number verification is required before you can receive SMS or voice notifications. This ensures notifications reach the correct responder.

## Best practices

### Test regularly

Use the test notification feature periodically to verify your phone number remains active and notifications are working correctly.

### Configure progressive escalation

Set up notification rules that start with less intrusive methods (mobile app push) and progress to more urgent channels (voice calls) if alerts aren't acknowledged.

### Update contact information

Keep your phone number current, especially when changing devices or phone plans. Update your contact methods in preferences immediately after any changes.

### Bypass Do Not Disturb

Configure your phone's settings to allow calls from incident.io's phone number even when Do Not Disturb mode is enabled.

## Mobile app integration

SMS and voice notifications complement the incident.io mobile app:

- **Mobile app push notifications** provide the richest experience with full alert context and quick actions
- **SMS** serves as a backup when the mobile app isn't available
- **Voice calls** ensure alerts reach you in any situation

For the best on-call experience, configure all three notification channels in your preferences.
