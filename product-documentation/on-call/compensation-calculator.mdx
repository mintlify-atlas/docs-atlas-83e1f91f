The compensation calculator helps organizations track on-call hours and calculate fair compensation for responders. Generate reports showing who was on-call, for how long, and during which hours to support compensation decisions.

## How compensation tracking works

incident.io automatically tracks on-call time based on your configured schedules:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Schedules define coverage">
    Your [schedules](/product-documentation/on-call/schedules-overview) determine who is on-call at any moment
  </Step>
  <Step title="Hours are logged">
    The system logs on-call hours for each responder, including overrides
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reports aggregate data">
    Generate reports for any time period to see total hours per person
  </Step>
  <Step title="Export for payroll">
    Export data to integrate with your payroll or HR systems
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Compensation tracking reflects actual coverage, including [overrides and cover requests](/product-documentation/on-call/overrides-and-cover-requests).

## What's included in reports

Compensation reports include detailed breakdowns:

### Per-person summary

| **Responder** | Person's name and email |
| **Total hours** | Total on-call hours during the period |
| **Weekday hours** | Hours during weekdays (typically less expensive) |

### Time-based breakdowns

Reports can break down compensation by:

  <Card title="Business vs after-hours" icon="clock">
    Separate rates for business hours vs evenings/nights
  </Card>
  <Card title="Weekday vs weekend" icon="calendar-week">
    Different compensation for weekend coverage
  </Card>
  <Card title="Holiday coverage" icon="gift">

  </Card>
  <Card title="Active incident time" icon="fire">
    Track time actively working on incidents separately
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Configure compensation rules

Define how your organization calculates on-call compensation:

### Define time periods

Create time period definitions that match your compensation policy:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Business hours">
    Monday-Friday, 9:00 AM - 5:00 PM in company timezone
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="After hours">
    Weekday evenings (5:00 PM - 9:00 AM) at a higher rate
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Weekend">
    Saturday and Sunday, all day, at premium rate
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Holidays">
    Company holiday calendar at highest premium rate
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Set compensation rates

Assign rates to each time period (examples):

| Period | Example rate | Description |
|--------|--------------|-------------|
| Business hours | $25/hour | Standard on-call during work hours |
| After hours weekday | $40/hour | Evenings and nights |
| Weekend | $60/hour | Saturday and Sunday coverage |
| Holiday | $80/hour | Company holidays |

<Warning>
Actual compensation rates vary by organization, role, and location. These are examples only.
</Warning>

## Overrides and compensation

[Overrides](/product-documentation/on-call/overrides-and-cover-requests) affect compensation tracking:

- The person who actually covers the shift (via override) receives credit for those hours
- The originally scheduled person does not receive credit for time they were replaced
- This ensures compensation accurately reflects who was actually on-call

<Tip>
Review override patterns in compensation reports to identify potential schedule adjustments needed for work-life balance.
</Tip>

## Active incident time

Some organizations compensate separately for time actively responding to incidents vs being on-call:

- **On-call hours**: Time scheduled to respond if needed
- **Active incident hours**: Time actively working on incidents

Compensation reports can track both:

- Total on-call hours from schedules
- Active incident participation time from incident timelines
- Alert acknowledgment and resolution activity

## Common compensation models

### Model 1: Flat weekly stipend

Pay a flat amount for each week of on-call duty:

- Simple to administer
- Same rate regardless of actual incidents
- Good for teams with predictable on-call load

### Model 2: Hourly with time-of-day premiums

Pay hourly rates that vary by time of day and day of week:

- More granular and fair
- Reflects that weekend/night coverage is more disruptive
- Requires more detailed tracking (incident.io handles this)

### Model 3: Base stipend + incident hours

Pay a base amount for being on-call plus hourly for active incident work:

- Balances simplicity with fairness
- Compensates actual disruption from incidents
- Popular with engineering teams

### Model 4: Time off in lieu

Provide additional PTO instead of monetary compensation:

- Some organizations prefer this approach
- Track on-call hours to award proportional time off
- Good for teams with generous PTO policies

## FAQs

    Compensation tracking is automatic based on your schedules. To configure rates and time periods, navigate to **On-call → Compensation → Settings** and define your compensation rules.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I backfill compensation data?">
    Yes. Compensation reports can be generated for any historical time period where you had schedules configured.

  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I handle partial hours?">
    Compensation reports track time down to the minute and round according to your configuration (e.g., round up to nearest 15 minutes, or track exact time).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I see who earned the most/least on-call time?">
