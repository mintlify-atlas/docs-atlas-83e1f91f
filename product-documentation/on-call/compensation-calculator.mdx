The compensation calculator tracks on-call hours for each responder, enabling fair compensation for time spent on-call. Export detailed reports for payroll, analyze on-call burden distribution, and ensure equitable coverage across your team.

Access compensation reporting from **On-call → Compensation** in the dashboard.

## Why track on-call compensation

Many organizations compensate responders for on-call time, either through:

- **Hourly compensation**: Pay per hour on-call
- **Stipends**: Fixed payment per shift or week
- **Time off in lieu**: Compensatory time off for on-call hours
- **Burden analysis**: Ensure fair distribution without financial compensation

incident.io's compensation calculator provides the data you need to implement any compensation model.

## How compensation tracking works

incident.io automatically tracks:

- **Scheduled hours**: Time each person was scheduled on-call
- **Override hours**: Time covering for someone else via overrides
- **Actual coverage**: Who was on-call accounting for schedule changes
- **Shift types**: Differentiate weekday vs. weekend vs. overnight
- **Team and schedule attribution**: Break down hours by team or schedule

<Info>
Compensation tracking runs automatically. No configuration required.

## Export compensation data

Export detailed compensation data for payroll systems or analysis:

1. Navigate to **On-call → Compensation**
2. Select your date range and filters
3. Click **Export** in the top right
4. Choose format:
   - **CSV**: Import into spreadsheets or payroll systems
   - **PDF**: Printable reports for records

### CSV export structure

The CSV export includes:

```csv
Responder,Email,Team,Schedule,Total Hours,Scheduled Hours,Override Hours,Weekday Hours,Weekend Hours,Overnight Hours
Alice Johnson,alice@example.com,Platform,Platform Primary,42.0,38.0,4.0,30.0,12.0,8.0
Bob Smith,bob@example.com,Platform,Platform Primary,38.0,38.0,0.0,38.0,0.0,0.0
```

Use this data to:
- Calculate compensation payments
- Import into payroll systems (Workday, ADP, Gusto)
- Analyze on-call distribution
- Audit compensation fairness

## Configure shift types

Customize which hours count as weekday, weekend, or overnight:

1. Navigate to **Settings → On-call → Compensation**
2. Configure shift type definitions:

### Weekday vs. weekend

Define which days are weekends:

- **Standard**: Saturday and Sunday
- **Custom**: Choose specific days (e.g., Friday and Saturday for some regions)

### Overnight hours

Define overnight shift hours:

- **Standard**: 10 PM - 8 AM
- **Custom**: Set specific start and end times
- **Timezone**: Use schedule timezone or responder timezone

<Tip>
Different schedules can use different shift type definitions. Configure per-schedule if needed.

## Compensation models

Common approaches to on-call compensation:

### Hourly rate model

Pay responders per hour on-call:

- **Weekday rate**: $X per hour during business days
- **Weekend rate**: $Y per hour on weekends (often higher)
- **Overnight rate**: $Z per hour for night shifts (often higher)

**Example calculation:**

```
Alice's weekly compensation:
- 30 weekday hours × $15/hour = $450
- 12 weekend hours × $25/hour = $300  
- 8 overnight hours × $20/hour = $160
Total: $910
```

### Weekly stipend model

Pay fixed amount for being primary on-call:

- **Primary on-call**: $X per week regardless of hours
- **Secondary on-call**: $Y per week (often less)
- **Override hours**: Additional $Z per hour

**Example calculation:**

```
Bob's weekly compensation:
- Primary on-call (Mon-Fri): $500
- 4 override hours: 4 × $25 = $100
Total: $600
```

### Time off in lieu

Grant compensatory time off instead of payment:

- 1 hour on-call = 0.5 hours time off (50% rate)
- Weekend/overnight multiplier: 1 hour = 1 hour time off (100% rate)

Track accrued time off and deduct when used.

### No financial compensation

Use compensation reporting for burden analysis:

- Identify uneven distribution of on-call hours
- Ensure fair rotation across team members
- Spot responders carrying too much load
- Plan hiring based on on-call burden

## Best practices

### Run reports weekly

Export compensation data weekly for payroll processing. Most organizations process on-call payments in the regular pay cycle.

### Audit monthly

Review monthly compensation reports to:

- Verify fair distribution across responders
- Identify responders with excessive on-call burden
- Plan schedule adjustments to balance load

### Document your model

Clearly document your compensation policy:

- Hourly rates or stipend amounts
- Weekend and overnight multipliers
- How overrides are compensated
- Time off in lieu accrual rates

Share the policy with responders so everyone understands compensation.

### Account for overrides

Ensure overrides are compensated fairly:

- Person providing coverage receives compensation
- Original scheduled person does not
- Make this clear in your compensation policy

### Track retroactive changes

When creating overrides retroactively, re-run compensation reports for affected periods to ensure accurate payment.

## Integration with payroll systems

Export compensation data to payroll systems:

### Manual CSV import

1. Export compensation CSV from incident.io
2. Map columns to payroll system fields
3. Import into payroll system (Workday, ADP, Gusto, BambooHR)
4. Process payments in regular pay cycle

### Automated integration

Use the incident.io API to automate compensation data export:

```bash
curl https://api.incident.io/v2/on-call/compensation \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -d "start_date=2026-02-01" \
  -d "end_date=2026-02-07"
```

See the [API documentation](https://api-docs.incident.io) for full details.

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Does compensation tracking include time spent responding to incidents?">
    No. Compensation tracking measures time on-call (available to respond), not active incident response time. Track incident response time separately if needed for additional compensation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How are overlapping schedules handled?">
    If someone is on-call for multiple schedules simultaneously, hours are counted once per schedule. The compensation report shows separate rows for each schedule.
    
    Example: If Alice is on-call for both "Platform Primary" and "Platform Secondary" for 8 hours, the report shows 8 hours for each schedule (16 total hours).
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I create an override after running a report?">
    Re-run the report for the affected time period. incident.io recalculates compensation based on the current schedule configuration, including retroactive overrides.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I export compensation data for a single person?">
    Yes. Filter by team or use the search function to find a specific responder, then export. The CSV will include only filtered results.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How are partial hours calculated?">
    Hours are calculated precisely, including partial hours. If someone is on-call for 3 hours and 45 minutes, the report shows 3.75 hours.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Does compensation tracking account for different timezones?">
    Yes. Hours are calculated based on the schedule's configured timezone. Weekday/weekend/overnight classifications use the schedule timezone unless configured otherwise.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I customize the CSV export format?">
    The CSV format is fixed, but you can use the API to retrieve raw data and format it as needed. See the [API documentation](https://api-docs.incident.io) for details.
