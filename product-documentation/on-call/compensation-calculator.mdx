The compensation calculator provides a streamlined way to track on-call hours and generate pay reports for responders without managing internal tooling and scripts. Calculate compensation based on configurable rules for different regions, roles, tiers, and time periods.

Access the pay calculator in **On-call → Pay calculator** (available to On-call customers only).

## Pay configurations

Pay configurations define the rules for calculating on-call compensation. Create one or more configurations depending on your organization's compensation structure.

### Single pay configuration

Use a single pay configuration when all on-call responders receive the same compensation rates.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create configuration">
    Navigate to **On-call → Pay calculator** and click **Configure**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set currency and timezone">
    Choose the currency for payments and the timezone for time-based calculations
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define pay rates">
    Configure hourly or daily rates for different time periods:
    - **Standard hours** - Weekday business hours
    - **Outside standard hours** - Evenings and weekends
    - **Holidays** - Special rates for holidays
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure holidays">
    Select which holidays require special compensation rates
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save configuration">
    Save the configuration for use in reports
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example single configuration:**
- **Currency:** USD
- **Timezone:** America/New_York (EST)
- **Hourly rates:**
  - Monday-Friday 9:00-17:00: $0/hr (no additional pay during business hours)
  - All other times: $25/hr
  - Holidays: $50/hr

### Multiple pay configurations

Use multiple pay configurations when responders receive different compensation based on location, role, or other factors.

**Common scenarios for multiple configurations:**
- **Location-based compensation** - Different rates for responders in different countries or regions
- **Role-based compensation** - Different rates for junior vs. senior engineers
- **Tier-based compensation** - Different rates for Tier 1 vs. Tier 2 on-call support

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create multiple configurations">
    Click **Configure** and create a separate pay configuration for each group (e.g., one for UK team, one for US team)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set up catalog relationships">
    Create catalog attributes that link users to the appropriate pay configuration:
    - Create a catalog type (e.g., "Office" with values like "London", "New York", "Melbourne")
    - Add a relationship from User to Office in your catalog
    - Link each user to their office location
  </Step>
  <Step title="Use expressions in reports">
    When generating reports, use expressions to map users to their appropriate pay configuration based on catalog relationships
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Example multiple configurations setup:**

**UK Configuration:**
- Currency: GBP
- Timezone: Europe/London (GMT)
- Hourly rates: £10/hr outside Monday-Friday 9:00-17:00
- Holidays: United Kingdom

**US Configuration:**
- Currency: USD
- Timezone: America/New_York (EST)
- Hourly rates: $15/hr outside Monday-Friday 8:00-18:00
- Holidays: United States

**Australia Configuration:**
- Currency: AUD
- Timezone: Australia/Melbourne (AEST)
- Hourly rates: $10/hr outside Monday-Friday 9:30-17:30
- Holidays: Australia

## Generating pay reports

Create pay reports to calculate compensation for a specific time period:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create new report">
    Navigate to **On-call → Pay calculator** and click **Create report**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure settings">
    - **Name** - Descriptive name for the report (e.g., "January 2026 on-call pay")
    - **Time range** - Period covered by the report (e.g., past month, specific date range)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select schedules">
    Choose which schedules should be included in compensation calculations
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure payments">
    Choose payment approach:
    - **Same pay rules for everyone** - Select a single pay configuration
    - **Different pay rules for different groups** - Use expressions to map users to appropriate pay configurations via catalog relationships
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify holidays">
    Review and adjust holiday dates if needed. You can:
    - Import public holidays automatically
    - Add custom company holidays
    - Remove holidays that don't apply
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generate draft">
    Generate the report in draft state to review calculations before finalizing
  </Step>
  <Step title="Review and publish">
    Review individual user compensation, verify calculations, and publish the report when ready
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Payment configuration with expressions

When using multiple pay configurations, map users to configurations using catalog expressions:

```text
if User > Office > Name == "London"
  then UK_Configuration
else if User > Office > Name == "New York"
  then US_Configuration  
else if User > Office > Name == "Melbourne"
  then Australia_Configuration
else
  Default_Configuration
```text

This automatically applies the correct pay configuration based on each user's office location from the catalog.

## Report features

### Deduplication

When responders are on-call for multiple schedules simultaneously, deduplication prevents double-counting hours:

- **Enabled** (recommended) - Pay only once for overlapping shifts
- **Disabled** - Pay for each schedule separately (may result in double payment)

Enable deduplication by selecting **Pay only once for overlapping shifts** when generating reports.

### Reusing previous reports

Create new reports based on previous ones to save configuration time:

1. Open an existing report
2. Click **Create using this report**
3. Update the time range
4. Generate the new report (schedules and pay configurations are reused)

This is especially useful for monthly recurring reports where configuration stays consistent.

### Export and share

Export reports in various formats for payroll systems or accounting:
- CSV for spreadsheet import
- PDF for records and approvals
- View detailed breakdown by user in the dashboard

## Holidays

Configure holidays that require special compensation rates:

### Import public holidays

Automatically import standard holidays for supported countries:
- United States
- United Kingdom
- Australia
- And more

Public holidays update automatically based on official holiday calendars.

### Custom holidays

Add company-specific holidays:
- Company founding day
- Office closure days
- Floating holidays
- Regional holidays not in public calendars

Custom holidays can have the same compensation rate as public holidays or different rates.

## Best practices

### Set up configurations before reports

Create and test pay configurations before you need to generate reports. This ensures rates are correct and catalog relationships are properly configured.

### Use catalog for multiple configurations

When using multiple pay configurations, always use catalog relationships (Office, Role, etc.) rather than manually mapping users to configurations. This scales better and updates automatically as users change locations or roles.

### Generate draft reports first

Always generate reports in draft state first. Review calculations, verify hourly totals, and confirm holiday handling before publishing.

### Document pay configuration changes

When you update pay configurations, note the effective date and reason. This creates an audit trail for compensation changes.

### Review deduplication settings

Ensure deduplication settings match your organization's compensation policy. Most organizations enable deduplication to avoid paying twice for overlapping shifts.

### Schedule regular report generation

Generate reports on a consistent schedule (e.g., monthly) to provide predictable compensation timing for responders.

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I edit a published report?">
    No. Once published, reports are immutable to maintain audit trails. If you need to make changes, generate a new report with corrected settings.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How are partial hours calculated?">
    Compensation calculates based on actual minutes on-call, then converts to hours. For example, 30 minutes at $20/hour = $10.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens with overrides?">
    Overrides are reflected in compensation reports. The person who covered the shift (not the originally scheduled person) receives compensation for that time.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I have different rates for weekdays vs weekends?">
    Yes. Configure different hourly rates for different time periods when setting up pay configurations. For example:
    - Monday-Friday 9:00-17:00: $0/hr
    - Monday-Friday outside 9:00-17:00: $20/hr
    - Saturday-Sunday: $30/hr
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do timezones affect pay calculations?">
    Pay calculations use the timezone specified in the pay configuration. This determines when "business hours" start and end for rate calculations. Ensure the timezone matches where the responder is located.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I export reports to payroll systems?">
    Yes. Export reports as CSV and import into your payroll system. The CSV includes user details, total hours, and total compensation.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if someone is on-call across multiple timezones?">
    The pay configuration's timezone determines rate calculations. If a responder travels across timezones while on-call, calculations still use the pay configuration's timezone (typically their home timezone).
