# Post-mortem writing

Writing thorough post-mortem documents after incidents is essential for organizational learning, but it's time-consuming and often delayed. AI-powered post-mortem generation assembles comprehensive post-mortem documents automatically from incident data, timelines, actions, and call transcripts, dramatically reducing the time required to document incidents.

## Why automate post-mortem writing?

Post-mortem writing faces consistent challenges:

- **Time-consuming** - Manually compiling information from multiple sources takes hours
- **Often delayed** - Responders prioritize other work over documentation
- **Incomplete** - Important context is forgotten or not captured
- **Inconsistent** - Different responders document incidents differently
- **Cognitively demanding** - Synthesizing scattered information into coherent narrative is hard

AI post-mortem generation addresses these challenges by automatically:
- Assembling timelines from structured incident data
- Extracting key moments from call transcripts
- Summarizing investigation findings and mitigation steps
- Identifying contributing factors and follow-up actions
- Formatting everything according to your organization's template

The result: a complete post-mortem draft ready for human review and refinement, available minutes after incident resolution.

## How post-mortem generation works

AI post-mortem generation pulls together information from multiple sources:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Data collection">
    The AI gathers all incident-related data:
    - Incident description, severity, and affected services
    - Complete timeline with timestamps
    - Actions created and completed
    - Status updates shared during the incident
    - Call transcripts from Scribe (if enabled)
    - Investigation results and root cause analysis
    - Slack messages from the incident channel
  </Step>

  <Step title="Narrative generation">
    The AI synthesizes collected data into coherent narrative sections:
    - Executive summary of what happened and impact
    - Detailed timeline of events
    - Root cause analysis
    - What went well and what went poorly
    - Contributing factors that enabled or worsened the incident
  </Step>

  <Step title="Action item extraction">
    The AI identifies and categorizes follow-up actions:
    - Prevention measures to avoid recurrence
    - Detection improvements to catch issues sooner
    - Response process improvements
    - Technical debt or system improvements needed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Template formatting">
    The AI formats the content according to your organization's post-mortem template, populating each section appropriately.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Human review">
    The generated post-mortem is presented as a draft for human review, editing, and refinement before being finalized.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Generated post-mortem sections

AI-generated post-mortems include comprehensive sections:

### Executive summary

A concise overview answering:
- What happened?
- What was the impact?
- What was the root cause?
- What are we doing to prevent recurrence?

**Example:**
```
On January 15, 2026, from 14:32 to 15:47 UTC, our payment processing 
system experienced a partial outage affecting approximately 15% of 
checkout attempts. The incident was caused by database connection pool 
exhaustion following a deployment that introduced inefficient queries. 
We mitigated by rolling back the deployment and scaling database 
connections. Estimated customer impact: $45K in delayed transactions. 
Prevention measures include query performance testing in staging and 
connection pool monitoring.
```

### Detailed timeline

Chronological sequence of events with timestamps:

```
14:15 UTC - Deployment v2.4.1 completed
14:32 UTC - Error rate began increasing on /api/checkout endpoint
14:35 UTC - Automated alert triggered, incident declared
14:38 UTC - Investigation identified database connection pool at 100%
14:45 UTC - Decision made to rollback deployment
14:52 UTC - Rollback completed, error rates decreasing
15:10 UTC - Error rates returned to baseline
15:47 UTC - Monitoring period completed, incident resolved
```

The AI automatically extracts this from incident timeline entries and call transcripts.

### Root cause analysis

Deep dive into why the incident occurred:

**What happened:**
Deployment v2.4.1 included a database query refactor that changed how order data was retrieved. The new query used a table scan instead of an index, increasing execution time from 50ms to 3 seconds.

**Why it wasn't caught:**
- Query tested with small dataset in staging (500 rows)
- Production database had 5M rows, exposing performance issue
- No query performance monitoring in deployment pipeline

**Contributing factors:**
- Database connection pool sized for fast queries (50ms average)
- Long-running queries held connections, exhausting pool
- No circuit breaker to prevent cascade failure

### What went well

Positive aspects of the incident response:

- Automated alerting triggered within 3 minutes of impact
- Investigation correctly identified database as culprit within 6 minutes
- Rollback decision made quickly once connection pool issue was understood
- Communication to customers was clear and timely
- Scribe captured all technical discussions, preventing context loss

### What went poorly

Areas for improvement:

- Query performance not tested with production-scale data
- 10-minute delay between incident declaration and paging database expert
- Status page update was 20 minutes after incident start
- No runbook for database connection pool exhaustion
- Monitoring didn't surface connection pool utilization proactively

### Follow-up actions

AI extracts and categorizes action items:

**Prevention:**
- [ ] Add query performance testing with production-scale datasets
- [ ] Implement query execution time limits at application layer
- [ ] Review all queries added in past 3 months for similar issues

**Detection:**
- [ ] Add alerting on database connection pool utilization >80%
- [ ] Create dashboard showing query execution time percentiles
- [ ] Enable slow query logging on production database

**Response:**
- [ ] Write runbook for database connection pool exhaustion
- [ ] Add database expert to primary escalation path
- [ ] Set up automatic status page updates for SEV-2+ incidents

**Technical improvements:**
- [ ] Implement connection pooling per-service instead of global
- [ ] Add circuit breaker for database queries >1 second
- [ ] Index optimization for orders table

## Creating AI-generated post-mortems

Generate post-mortems after incident resolution:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to post-incidents">
    From the dashboard, go to **Post-incidents** or open the resolved incident's homepage.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Click 'Create post-mortem'">
    incident.io detects available incident data and offers to generate a post-mortem.

    <Note>
      Post-mortems can only be generated for resolved incidents. Active incidents need to be closed first.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose generation method">
    Select how to generate the post-mortem:
    - **AI-generated** - Automatic generation from incident data (recommended)
    - **Manual** - Start with a blank template
    - **From previous** - Copy structure from a past post-mortem
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select template">
    Choose which post-mortem template to use. AI will populate sections according to the selected template's structure.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Review and edit">
    The AI-generated draft appears in the post-mortem editor. Review each section:
    - Verify factual accuracy
    - Add context AI couldn't infer
    - Adjust tone and framing
    - Remove any sensitive information
    - Add team-specific insights
  </Step>

  <Step title="Export or attach">
    Once satisfied:
    - **Edit in incident.io** - Use the built-in post-mortem editor
    - **Export to Google Docs** - Create a Google Doc with the content
    - **Export to Notion** - Create a Notion page
    - **Export to Confluence** - Create a Confluence page
    - **Copy to clipboard** - Paste into any editor

    After exporting, attach the external document to the incident for easy reference.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Customizing post-mortem templates

AI generates content matching your organization's post-mortem structure:

### Creating templates

1. Navigate to **Settings → Post-mortem**
2. Click **Create template**
3. Define sections:
   - Section name
   - Section description (helps AI understand what content belongs here)
   - Section order
   - Whether section is required

### Standard template sections

Common sections AI understands well:

- **Executive Summary** - High-level overview
- **Timeline** - Chronological sequence of events
- **Impact** - Customer and business effects
- **Root Cause** - Why the incident occurred
- **Detection** - How the incident was discovered
- **Response** - What was done to resolve it
- **What Went Well** - Positive aspects
- **What Could Be Improved** - Areas for growth
- **Action Items** - Follow-up tasks
- **Lessons Learned** - Key takeaways

### Custom sections

You can define organization-specific sections:

- **Regulatory Compliance Notes** - For regulated industries
- **Customer Communication Log** - Record of external communications
- **Cost Analysis** - Financial impact breakdown
- **Similar Past Incidents** - References to related incidents
- **Architectural Context** - System design considerations

Provide clear descriptions for custom sections so AI understands what content to generate.

### Section variables

Use variables in templates to automatically populate metadata:

- `{{ incident.name }}` - Incident name
- `{{ incident.severity }}` - Severity level
- `{{ incident.started_at }}` - When incident began
- `{{ incident.resolved_at }}` - When incident was resolved
- `{{ incident.lead }}` - Incident lead name
- `{{ incident.services }}` - Affected services

AI-generated content appears in the body sections, while variables populate metadata fields.

## Integration with external tools

Seamlessly export post-mortems to your documentation system:

2. Paste into your documentation tool
3. Formatting is preserved in most modern editors
4. Manually attach the document link to the incident

## Enhancing post-mortem quality

Improve AI-generated post-mortem accuracy:

### During the incident

**Add timeline entries** - Use `/inc timeline` to record key decisions and events with timestamps. These populate the post-mortem timeline automatically.

**Document investigation** - When Investigation results appear, review and correct any inaccuracies before they propagate to the post-mortem.

**Use Scribe** - Enable call transcription to capture detailed technical discussions that enrich root cause analysis.

**Create actions explicitly** - Use `/inc action` to track follow-up items. These automatically populate action item sections.

### After resolution

**Review immediately** - Generate the post-mortem while the incident is fresh. Accuracy is highest right after resolution.

**Add human insight** - AI captures facts well but may miss nuance. Add team insights about what was particularly challenging or surprising.

**Validate technical details** - Verify AI correctly understood technical root cause. Adjust if oversimplified or incorrect.

**Include learnings** - AI suggests learnings based on what happened, but humans should add broader organizational lessons.

## Best practices

<Tip>
  **Generate early, refine later** - Create the AI draft immediately after resolution. You can always edit it before the post-mortem meeting.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Use templates consistently** - Standardized templates make AI generation more accurate and help teams find information across post-mortems.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Combine AI with collaboration** - Let AI create the first draft, then use collaborative editing (Google Docs, Notion) for team refinement.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Link related incidents** - Reference similar past incidents in your post-mortem. AI sometimes suggests these; add others if relevant.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Update action items** - Post-mortem action items should flow into your task tracking system (Jira, Linear, Asana). Track completion separately.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Generated post-mortem is too short or lacks detail">
    Post-mortem quality depends on incident data richness. Improve detail by:
    - Adding more timeline entries during incidents
    - Enabling Scribe to capture call discussions
    - Running Investigations for root cause analysis
    - Creating explicit actions instead of just discussing them
    - Writing detailed incident descriptions
    
    The more structured data incident.io has, the better the generated post-mortem.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Root cause section is inaccurate">
    AI generates root cause from:
    - Investigation results
    - Timeline entries
    - Call transcripts
    - Status updates
    
    If root cause is wrong, the source data may be incomplete or unclear. Always review and correct root cause analysis manually—this is too critical to fully automate.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Timeline is missing important events">
    The AI-generated timeline includes:
    - Explicit timeline entries (from `/inc timeline`)
    - Status changes
    - Major actions created
    - Key moments from call transcripts
    
    If events are missing, they likely weren't recorded during the incident. Add them manually to the post-mortem timeline.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I regenerate a post-mortem after editing?">
    Currently, regeneration replaces the entire draft. If you've made significant edits:
    - Save your edited version before regenerating
    - Compare regenerated version to your edits
    - Merge the best content from both
    
    Future versions may support section-level regeneration to preserve manual edits.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Post-mortem includes sensitive information">
    AI-generated content may occasionally include:
    - Customer names from incident discussions
    - Internal system details that shouldn't be widely shared
    - Sensitive debugging information
    
    Always review generated post-mortems before sharing, especially if they'll be accessible outside your immediate team. Redact sensitive details.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Privacy and data handling

Post-mortem generation uses:
- All incident data (description, timeline, actions, status updates)
- Call transcripts (if Scribe enabled)
- Investigation results
- Slack messages from incident channels

Data is processed by AI models (typically OpenAI or Anthropic) but is not used for model training. Generated post-mortems are stored as part of incident records. For complete details, see [AI Privacy Guidance](https://trust.incident.io/).
