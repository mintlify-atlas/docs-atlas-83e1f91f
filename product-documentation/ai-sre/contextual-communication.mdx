# Contextual communication

Communicating clearly during incidents is challenging. Responders need to update stakeholders, customers, and internal teams while simultaneously working to resolve the incident. AI-powered contextual communication helps you craft accurate, appropriate updates quickly by analyzing incident context and suggesting relevant content for different audiences.

## Why contextual communication matters

During incidents, different audiences need different information:

- **Customers** need to know impact and estimated resolution time
- **Leadership** needs severity, business impact, and mitigation status
- **Internal teams** need technical details and coordination updates
- **Status pages** need concise, public-appropriate status messages

Crafting appropriate messages for each audience while managing the incident creates cognitive load and slows down communication. AI contextual communication reduces this burden by suggesting tailored content based on:

- Incident severity and type
- Affected services and impact scope
- Current incident stage (investigating, fixing, monitoring)
- Audience (internal, external, technical, non-technical)
- Your organization's communication patterns from past incidents

## Suggested incident summaries

When sharing incident updates, AI suggests concise summaries that capture the current state:

### How summaries are generated

AI analyzes multiple data sources to create summaries:

- **Incident description** - Initial problem statement
- **Timeline events** - Key actions and decisions made
- **Status changes** - Progression through incident lifecycle
- **Call transcripts** - Key moments and discussions from incident calls
- **Slack messages** - Important context from the incident channel
- **Investigation results** - Root cause findings and mitigation attempts

### When summaries appear

Suggested summaries surface at key moments:

- **Status update dialog** - When using `/inc update` or clicking "Share update" in the dashboard
- **Status page updates** - When posting to public or internal status pages
- **Leadership notifications** - When escalating or sending executive updates
- **Shift handoffs** - When incident lead role transfers to another responder

### Customizing summaries

AI-generated summaries appear as suggestions, not final content. You can:

1. **Accept as-is** - Use the suggested summary directly
2. **Edit before sending** - Modify to add context or adjust tone
3. **Regenerate** - Request a different summary if the first doesn't fit
4. **Write manually** - Ignore the suggestion and write from scratch

<Tip>
  Always review AI-generated summaries before sharing externally. The AI captures facts accurately but may need tone adjustments for customer-facing communications.
</Tip>

## Status page update drafts

Updating status pages during incidents requires careful wording—technical enough to be accurate, but accessible enough for customers to understand. AI helps draft status page updates appropriate for public audiences.

### Update types

AI suggests different update styles based on incident stage:

**Investigating:**
```text
We're investigating increased error rates affecting checkout functionality. 
Customers may experience payment processing delays. We're actively working 
to identify the root cause and will provide updates every 30 minutes.
```text

**Identified:**
```text
We've identified a database connection issue causing checkout errors. 
Our team is implementing a fix. Estimated time to resolution is 20-30 minutes.
```text

**Monitoring:**
```text
A fix has been deployed and error rates are returning to normal. We're 
monitoring closely to ensure full recovery. Checkout functionality should 
be working normally now.
```text

**Resolved:**
```text
The incident has been resolved. All checkout functionality is operating 
normally. We apologize for any inconvenience caused.
```text

### Public vs. internal status pages

AI adjusts tone and detail based on status page type:

- **Public pages** - Less technical detail, customer-focused impact language
- **Private customer pages** - More technical detail, specific service names
- **Internal pages** - Full technical context, internal system names

### Component-specific updates

For status pages with multiple components, AI suggests which components to mark as affected and crafts component-specific updates:

```text
API Gateway: Degraded Performance
Payment Processing: Partial Outage
Dashboard: Operational
```text

Updates reference only affected components, keeping status page noise minimal.

## Customer communication templates

For incidents requiring direct customer communication (email, support tickets, social media), AI suggests appropriately worded messages:

### Email templates

**Subject line suggestions:**
- "Update on [service name] performance issues"
- "Resolved: Temporary [service name] disruption"
- "Scheduled maintenance notification"

**Body content:**
AI drafts complete email content including:
- Clear description of customer impact (not internal technical details)
- What customers should expect or do
- Apology if appropriate
- Timeline for resolution or next update
- Contact information for additional help

### Support response templates

For customer support teams responding to incident-related tickets, AI suggests:

- Acknowledgment messages confirming the issue is known
- Status update messages for ongoing incidents
- Resolution confirmation messages
- Explanation of what happened (post-resolution)

### Social media responses

For organizations that communicate via Twitter, Slack communities, or other social channels, AI suggests brief, appropriate responses:

```text
We're aware of login issues and investigating. We'll share updates 
here and on our status page: [link]
```text

Short-form messages prioritize transparency and provide links to detailed information.

## Stakeholder notification content

Internal stakeholders need different information than customers. AI helps craft updates for:

### Executive summaries

For leadership, AI suggests concise summaries covering:

- **Business impact** - Revenue, customer, or reputation effects
- **Severity and urgency** - Is this escalating or improving?
- **Current status** - What's being done right now?
- **Estimated resolution** - When will this be fixed?
- **Ownership** - Who's leading the response?

**Example executive summary:**
```text
SEV-2 incident affecting payment processing. Approximately $15K/hour 
revenue impact. Root cause identified as database connection issue. 
Fix in progress, estimated resolution in 30 minutes. Chris Lee leading 
response with support team paged.
```text

### Cross-team notifications

For teams affected by the incident but not directly responding (customer success, sales, support), AI suggests updates that:

- Explain customer-facing impact
- Provide talking points for customer conversations
- Share expected resolution timeline
- Offer ways they can help or escalate issues

### Post-resolution communications

After incidents resolve, AI helps draft "all clear" messages:

- Confirmation that the incident is resolved
- Summary of what happened
- What was done to fix it
- Whether customers need to take any action
- Link to post-mortem (if/when available)

## Suggested follow-up messages

AI identifies when follow-up communication is needed:

### During long incidents

For incidents lasting over 30-60 minutes, AI prompts for periodic updates:

```text
⏰ It's been 45 minutes since the last status update. Consider sharing 
an update with stakeholders.

Suggested update:
"Investigation continues. We've ruled out recent deployments and are 
focusing on database performance issues. Next update in 30 minutes."
```text

### After incident resolution

AI suggests timing for post-resolution communications:

- Immediate: "All clear" confirmation
- +24 hours: Link to completed post-mortem
- +1 week: Summary of follow-up improvements completed

### For unresolved questions

If incident discussions raised questions that weren't answered, AI reminds responders to follow up:

```text
❓ From incident call transcript: "Will this affect the deployment 
scheduled for tomorrow?" — No answer recorded.

Consider following up with the team.
```text

## Communication patterns and learning

AI learns from your organization's communication patterns:

### Tone and style

By analyzing past incident updates, AI learns:
- Formal vs. casual tone preferences
- Technical depth appropriate for each audience
- Common phrases and terminology your organization uses
- How apologetic or matter-of-fact messaging should be

### Update frequency

AI recognizes your organization's update cadence:
- How often do you typically share status updates?
- When do you transition from frequent updates to less frequent ones?
- What triggers "all hands" broad stakeholder communications?

### Escalation thresholds

AI learns when to suggest broader communication:
- What severity level triggers executive notification?
- Which incident types require customer email campaigns?
- When should marketing/PR be looped in?

## Configuring contextual communication

Customize AI communication assistance:

### Enable communication suggestions

1. Navigate to **Settings → AI**
2. Toggle on **Communication assistance**
3. Select where suggestions should appear:
   - Status updates (default: on)
   - Status page updates (default: on)
   - Email templates (default: on)

### Define audience templates

Create audience-specific templates that AI uses as starting points:

1. Navigate to **Settings → Communication**
2. Add audience types (Executive, Customer Support, Engineering)
3. Define standard sections for each audience
4. AI will fill these templates with incident-specific content

### Set communication policies

Define when certain communications are required:

- SEV-1 incidents → Automatic executive notification
- Public status page updates → Require approval
- Customer email → Only for incidents over 1 hour
- Social media → Only for SEV-1 or SEV-2

AI suggestions adapt to these policies.

## Best practices

<Tip>
  **Edit for audience** - AI drafts are starting points. Always adjust tone and detail for specific audiences before sending.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Be honest about uncertainty** - If root cause isn't confirmed, say so. AI suggestions sometimes sound more confident than they should. Add appropriate caveats.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Update frequently early, less often later** - During active incidents, frequent updates (every 20-30 minutes) keep stakeholders informed. As incidents stabilize, reduce frequency.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Link to status pages** - Instead of duplicating status information in multiple channels, link to your status page as the single source of truth.
</Tip>

<Tip>
  **Proofread timestamps and metrics** - AI-generated updates include times and numbers. Verify these are accurate before sharing.
</Tip>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Suggested summaries don't match incident reality">
    This can happen when:
    - Investigation findings aren't documented in the incident
    - Important context is in Slack but not structured data
    - Recent status changes haven't been recorded
    
    Improve accuracy by:
    - Adding timeline entries for key decisions
    - Using `/inc update` to record status changes
    - Ensuring Investigation results are visible
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Communication tone doesn't match our style">
    AI learns from past incident communications. If tone is off:
    - Edit suggestions to match your preferred style
    - Over time, AI will adapt to your edits
    - Consider creating audience-specific templates at Settings → Communication
    
    You can also provide feedback on suggestions to train the system.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Suggestions include internal jargon for customer updates">
    AI occasionally includes internal system names or technical jargon in customer-facing suggestions. Always:
    - Review suggestions before sharing externally
    - Replace internal names with customer-familiar terms
    - Simplify technical language for non-technical audiences
    
    Report instances where jargon appears inappropriately to help improve filtering.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="No suggestions appearing for status updates">
    Communication suggestions require:
    - Communication assistance enabled at Settings → AI
    - Adequate incident context (description, timeline, status)
    - Integration with status page systems
    
    If suggestions aren't appearing, verify settings and ensure the incident has sufficient documented context.
  </Accordion>
