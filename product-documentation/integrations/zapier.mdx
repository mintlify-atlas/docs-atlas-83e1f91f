# Using Zapier

Connect your Zapier account with incident.io to declare incidents when something happens in another system.

## Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the incident.io Zapier app">
    First, install the incident.io Zapier app, by clicking "Accept Invite & Build a Zap" on this [invite page](https://zapier.com/developer/public-invite/162447/c60b514649e6aeb2a3d29594e7943a9d/).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Zap with a trigger">
    Click "Create Zap" and choose a trigger from one of your other systems. For this example we're using the "incoming email" trigger:

  </Step>

  <Step title="Search for incident.io">
    In the "Action" section, search for "incident.io":

  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Create Incident action">
    Select the "Create Incident" action:

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add API key">
    Click "sign in" to add an API key:

    This will open a new window where you can paste in an API Key. Generate one from the ["API Keys" section of our dashboard](https://app.incident.io/settings/api-keys). You'll need to give it permission to create incidents, view data (like public incidents and organisation settings), and view catalog types and entries.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Paste the key into Zapier">
    Paste the key into Zapier, and click "Yes, Continue"

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure incident information">
    Now configure the incident information: the minimum required fields are:

    - **"idempotency key"**: we'll only ever create one incident for each unique value here, so this should be something that uniquely identifies the trigger. In this example, each email is assigned a "Message ID", so using that as the idempotency key means we'll only open one incident for each email.
    - **Severity**: select this from the dropdown
    - **Visibility**: whether this incident should be public or private

    <Tip>
    You can also pre-fill custom fields, and assign roles by either email address or Slack user ID.
