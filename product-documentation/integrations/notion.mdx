# Notion

After your incident is over, it can be useful to dig into what happened in an incident, why, and how it can be prevented in the future.

Our Notion Integration allows you to export post-mortems into Notion. Which you can then use to collaborate with your team.

## Installation

<Info>
It's important to know that when the integration is installed, the connection to incident.io will belong to **the user who installed it**. Notion connections like this, which use OAuth, belong to a specific user — for this reason, you may wish to set up a dedicated service or "bot" account.
</Info>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to integrations">
    Go to [Settings → Integrations](https://app.incident.io/settings/integrations), find "Notion" and click "Install".

    Congratulations, it's been installed!

    You'll find the page in your private Notion space – move it to somewhere that suits you, and that can be accessed by everyone.
