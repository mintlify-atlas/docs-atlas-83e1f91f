# Backstage

We offer the ability to import Backstage catalog data into the incident.io Catalog, either by pulling entries directly from the Backstage API or by loading catalog-info.yaml files.

## Getting Started

To learn more about importing Backstage catalog data, **go to our** [**GitHub repository**](https://github.com/incident-io/catalog-importer/tree/master/docs/backstage) **and follow the steps outlined in the README.**

<Info>
The catalog importer supports two methods:
1. **API Integration**: Pull data directly from your Backstage API
2. **File-based Import**: Load catalog-info.yaml files directly
</Info>

## What Gets Imported

When you import from Backstage, the following catalog entities are synchronized:

- **Services**: Your application services and microservices
- **Components**: Individual software components
- **Systems**: Groups of related components and services
- **Resources**: Infrastructure resources
- **APIs**: API definitions and specifications

## Benefits

Integrating Backstage with incident.io gives you:

- **Single Source of Truth**: Keep your service catalog consistent across tools
- **Automatic Updates**: Changes in Backstage automatically sync to incident.io
- **Rich Metadata**: Import ownership, dependencies, and other metadata
- **Better Incident Context**: Quickly identify affected services and their owners during incidents
