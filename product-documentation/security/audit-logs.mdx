Audit logs give you visibility into changes made within your incident.io account. They track configuration changes, permission updates, and system actions, providing a complete record of who changed what and when.

Use audit logs to meet compliance requirements, investigate unexpected changes, or understand how your incident.io setup evolved over time. Available on the [Enterprise plan](https://incident.io/pricing), logs are powered by [WorkOS](https://workos.com/) and retained for one year.

Access audit logs at **Settings → Security**. View entries in the dashboard, export to CSV, or stream to your SIEM provider.

<Note>
Audit log entries are available from April 18, 2023 onwards. You must be an Owner or Admin to access audit logs.
</Note>

<Info>
Audit logs are a critical security tool, providing an immutable record of all configuration changes and administrative actions in your incident.io account.
</Info>

## What's tracked

Audit logs track configuration changes across incident.io, including:
- Alert sources, routes, and escalation paths
- Schedule and on-call configuration changes
- User role assignments and permission updates
- Access grants to private incidents
- Workflow and automation changes
- Integration configurations

Each entry captures the actor (person or system making the change), the target (what was modified), and contextual details like location and user agent. Entries conform to a versioned schema documented in the [API reference](https://api-docs.incident.io/tag/Audit-logs), ensuring consistent parsing as the format evolves.

### Event types

Audit logs capture these categories of events:

**User and permission changes**
- User role assignments
- Custom role creation and modification
- Team role assignments
- Permission grants and revocations

**Security configuration**
- SAML/SSO setup and changes
- SCIM configuration updates
- API key creation and deletion
- Access grants to private incidents

**System configuration**
- Alert route modifications
- Escalation path changes
- Schedule and rotation updates
- Integration setup and configuration

**Workflow and automation**
- Workflow creation and edits
- Announcement rule changes
- Custom field definitions

## Viewing audit logs

View audit logs in the [security settings](https://app.incident.io/settings/security) dashboard. Filter entries by target, event type, actor, and date. Export to CSV for a specific time period, or set up continuous streaming to your SIEM provider.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Security settings">
    Go to **Settings → Security** and click the **Audit logs** tab.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Filter events">
    Use the filter controls to narrow down events by actor, target, event type, or date range.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review details">
    Click any event to see full details including the actor, timestamp, target resource, and changes made.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Export if needed">
    Export filtered results to CSV for offline analysis or compliance documentation.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Understanding audit log entries

Each audit log entry includes:
- **Event**: The type of action performed (e.g., "user.role_assigned")
- **Actor**: Who performed the action (user email or system)
- **Target**: What was modified (resource type and ID)
- **Timestamp**: When the action occurred (in UTC)
- **Metadata**: Additional context (IP address, user agent, location)
- **Changes**: Before and after values for modifications

<Info>
Audit logs use a versioned schema to ensure backward compatibility. Check the schema version when parsing logs programmatically.
</Info>

## Streaming to SIEM providers

Stream audit logs directly to your security information and event management (SIEM) platform. incident.io supports streaming to:
- Datadog
- Splunk
- Amazon S3 buckets
- Other WorkOS-compatible providers

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Audit logs settings">
    Go to **Settings → Security → Audit logs** and click **Configure streaming**.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose your SIEM provider">
    Select your SIEM platform from the list of supported providers.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure connection">
    Follow the provider-specific instructions to set up the connection. You'll need API credentials or connection details from your SIEM platform.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test and enable">
    Test the connection to ensure logs are flowing correctly, then enable streaming.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Datadog integration

When streaming to Datadog:
- Logs appear in Datadog Logs with source `incident.io`
- Automatic parsing of structured fields
- Retention controlled by your Datadog configuration

### Splunk integration

When streaming to Splunk:
- Logs sent via HTTP Event Collector (HEC)
- JSON format for easy parsing
- Configure index and source type in Splunk

### S3 integration

When streaming to S3:
- Logs written as JSON files
- Partitioned by date for efficient querying
- Configure bucket, path, and IAM permissions

<Warning>
Ensure your SIEM provider credentials are properly secured. Audit log streaming requires write access to your SIEM platform.
</Warning>

## API access

Access audit log entries programmatically via the incident.io API. See the [Audit logs API documentation](https://api-docs.incident.io/tag/Audit-logs) for available endpoints and schema details.

### Example use cases

**Compliance reporting**: Query audit logs to generate reports showing all permission changes during a specific period.

**Security investigation**: Search for all actions performed by a specific user or from a suspicious IP address.

**Change tracking**: Monitor configuration changes to understand how your incident response setup has evolved.

**Automated alerting**: Build integrations that alert on specific audit log events (e.g., permission grants to sensitive incidents).

<Info>
The API supports pagination, filtering by event type, actor, and date range, making it easy to build custom integrations and reporting tools.
</Info>

## Retention and compliance

Audit logs are retained for one year from the date of the event. For longer retention periods, export logs to your SIEM provider or storage system.

Audit logs support common compliance frameworks:
- **SOC 2**: Provides evidence of access controls and change management
- **ISO 27001**: Demonstrates monitoring and logging of security events
- **GDPR**: Tracks access to personal data and permission changes
- **HIPAA**: Documents who accessed what data and when

<Note>
For compliance purposes, consider streaming audit logs to a tamper-proof archive with extended retention (e.g., S3 with object lock).
