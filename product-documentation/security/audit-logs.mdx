Audit logs give you visibility into changes made within your incident.io account. They track configuration changes, permission updates, and system actions, providing a complete record of who changed what and when.

<Info>
Available on the [Enterprise plan](https://incident.io/pricing), logs are powered by [WorkOS](https://workos.com/) and retained for one year.
</Info>

Use audit logs to meet compliance requirements, investigate unexpected changes, or understand how your incident.io setup evolved over time.

Access audit logs at **Settings → Security**. View entries in the dashboard, export to CSV, or stream to your SIEM provider.

<Note>
Audit log entries are available from April 18, 2023 onwards. You must be an Owner or Admin to access audit logs.
