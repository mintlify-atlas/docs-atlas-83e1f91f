## Automatic seat assignment

We automatically graduate users to a Response seats when they take any response-related action (like changing an incident status or posting an update).

<Info>
For On-call seats, we'll ask you to confirm before upgrading a user when you:
- Add them to a schedule
- Add them to an escalation path
</Info>

## Removing seats

<Warning>
Users are only removed from Response or On-call seats if:
- You manually downgrade them in [Settings > Users](https://app.incident.io/settings/users)
- Their Slack account is deleted
</Warning>

They won't lose their seat if they stop taking actions - you have to explicitly downgrade them.
