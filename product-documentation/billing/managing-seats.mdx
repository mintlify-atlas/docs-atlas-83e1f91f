## Automatic seat assignment

We automatically graduate users to a Response seats when they take any response-related action (like changing an incident status or posting an update).

For On-call seats, we'll ask you to confirm before upgrading a user when you:
- Add them to a schedule
- Add them to an escalation path

<Info>
Users are automatically upgraded to Response seats when they perform response actions, ensuring you only pay for seats that are actively being used.
</Info>

## Removing seats

Users are only removed from Response or On-call seats if:
- You manually downgrade them in [Settings > Users](https://app.incident.io/settings/users)
- Their Slack account is deleted

<Warning>
Users won't lose their seat if they stop taking actions - you have to explicitly downgrade them to remove the seat.
</Warning>

## Best practices

<Steps>
  <Step title="Review seat usage regularly">
    Check your seat usage in [Settings > Billing](https://app.incident.io/settings/billing) to ensure you're only paying for active users.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Downgrade inactive users">
    If someone no longer needs Response or On-call capabilities, manually downgrade them to a Viewer seat in [Settings > Users](https://app.incident.io/settings/users).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Monitor automatic upgrades">
    Keep track of users being automatically upgraded to Response seats to understand your team's incident response patterns.
