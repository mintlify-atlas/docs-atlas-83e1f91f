## Monthly billing

Available for Team Plans only.

We charge you at the start of each month based on your current active seats. On subsequent months, we adjust for any changes:
- If you added seats during the month, we charge for the overage (prorated daily)
- If you removed seats, we credit your account (prorated daily)

Your billing date stays the same each month.

</Steps>

## Annual billing

### Team Plan

Pay upfront for 12 months based on the seats you're using when you sign up. We calculate any overages or downgrades throughout the year and settle up on your anniversary date.

### Pro and Enterprise Plans

Work with our sales team to estimate the seats you'll need for the year. We invoice you on your service start date.

If you need to add more seats during the year, you have two options:
- **Co-term contract**: Add seats at a reduced rate, extending to your renewal date
- **Annual true-up**: We bill you at the end of the year for additional seats (prorated daily)

<Note>
Contact your account manager or sales team to discuss seat additions on annual Pro and Enterprise plans.
</Note>

## Seat limits

**Team Plan:** Add or remove seats freely - no limits

**Pro and Enterprise Plans:** Hard seat limits based on your contract. Contact our sales team if you need to increase your limit.

<Warning>
If you reach your seat limit on a Pro or Enterprise plan, additional users won't be able to access paid features until you increase your limit.
</Warning>

  <Accordion title="Do you have a W-9 or W8-BEN form?">
    We're a UK-based company so we use form a W8-BEN instead of a W-9. You can download that [here](https://help.incident.io/articles/1324106831-do-you-have-a-w-9-or-w8-ben-form%3F).
