Our pricing is based on the number of Response and On-call seats you use. You can choose monthly or annual billing depending on your plan.

## Monthly billing

<Note>
Available for Team Plans only.
</Note>

We charge you at the start of each month based on your current active seats. On subsequent months, we adjust for any changes:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial charge">
    Charged at the start of the month for current active seats
  </Step>
  <Step title="Seat additions">
    If you added seats during the month, we charge for the overage (prorated daily)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Seat removals">
    If you removed seats, we credit your account (prorated daily)
  </Step>
</Steps>

Your billing date stays the same each month.

## Annual billing

### Team Plan

Pay upfront for 12 months based on the seats you're using when you sign up. We calculate any overages or downgrades throughout the year and settle up on your anniversary date.

### Pro and Enterprise Plans

Work with our sales team to estimate the seats you'll need for the year. We invoice you on your service start date.

<Info>
If you need to add more seats during the year, you have two options:
- **Co-term contract**: Add seats at a reduced rate, extending to your renewal date
- **Annual true-up**: We bill you at the end of the year for additional seats (prorated daily)

## FAQs

  <Accordion title="Do you have a W-9 or W8-BEN form?">
    We're a UK-based company so we use form a W8-BEN instead of a W-9. You can download that [here](https://help.incident.io/articles/1324106831-do-you-have-a-w-9-or-w8-ben-form%3F).
