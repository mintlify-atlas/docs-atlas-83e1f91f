## Deleting your organization

To delete your organization, contact [help@incident.io](mailto:help@incident.io). You must be the organization owner or have appropriate admin permissions, and contact us from your registered account email address or Slack.

<Warning>
Deleting your organization is permanent and cannot be undone. All data, incidents, and configurations will be permanently removed.
</Warning>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Contact support">
    Email [help@incident.io](mailto:help@incident.io) from your registered account email address or reach out via Slack.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Provide organization details">
    Include your organization URL (e.g., `https://app.incident.io/your-org-name`) in your request.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Confirm deletion">
    The support team will verify your identity and permissions, then process the deletion request.
  </Step>
</Steps>

After deletion completes:
- You'll receive confirmation from support
- All users lose access to the organization
- Automated emails and notifications stop
- You can create a new account if you want to use incident.io again in the future

## Deleting your user account

Individual user accounts are synchronized with your Slack profile and cannot be deleted directly from incident.io. Organization owners or admins can downgrade your permissions to the Viewer role at **Settings → Users**, but complete account deletion requires deactivating a user's Slack profile.

<Note>
Enterprise customers using SCIM can deprovision users through their identity provider.
</Note>

### How to remove a user

<Steps>
  <Step title="Downgrade to Viewer">
    Organization owners or admins can downgrade users to Viewer seats in **Settings → Users**, removing any paid seat assignments.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Deactivate in Slack">
    To completely remove a user from incident.io, deactivate their Slack account in your workspace.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="SCIM users (Enterprise)">
    If using SCIM, unassign the user from the incident.io application in your identity provider to automatically deprovision them.
  </Step>
</Steps>
