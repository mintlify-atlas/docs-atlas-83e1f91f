Insights gives you analytics across your incidents, follow-ups, and on-call activity. You can filter data by date ranges, incident attributes, and custom fields, and save frequently used filter combinations as shared views.

## Date range filtering

When filtering for date range inside Insights, you can choose from preset ranges or define custom relative ranges:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Include current period" icon="calendar-plus">
    You can include data from the current Week/Month/Quarter by selecting the "Include this Week/Month/Quarter" option under custom relative range.
    
    This is useful when you want to track metrics for an in-progress time period alongside completed periods.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Compare with previous period" icon="chart-line">
    You can also compare with the previous period by toggling it on. For example, you might compare this month's incidents with last month's to spot trends.
    
    Period comparisons help identify patterns and measure improvements over time.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Info>
Custom relative ranges let you define rolling windows (like last 30 days, or last quarter) that automatically update as time progresses.
</Info>

## Data refresh frequency

Insights data is refreshed roughly every three hours. This means that recently created or updated incidents will not show up in Insights immediately.

<Warning>
If you're scheduling reports or doing analysis, it's worth keeping this refresh cadence in mind to ensure you're working with the latest data.
</Warning>

## Saved views

You can use filters to drill down into specific data when on the follow-ups, incidents, or insights pages. **Saved views** allow you to save these filters and share them with others in your organization.

### Creating a saved view

To create a saved view, add some filtering and sorting of your choice. You can choose from any of these options:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Incident filtering" icon="filter">
    - Include/exclude private incidents
    - Filter by incident attribute or custom field
    - Sort by an incident attribute
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Data grouping" icon="layer-group">
    - Split results by severity
    - Split by incident type
    - Split by a custom field
    - Filter by follow-up status
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure filters">
    Add filtering and sorting options to your view based on your analysis needs.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save the view">
    Click on the **Save View** button in the top right corner of the screen.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Name your view">
    Give your view a descriptive name and click **Save**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Your view will be visible to everyone in your organization.
</Note>

### Managing saved views

To rename, share, or delete your view, click on its name. If you want to go back to the default view, click on the page name above your view's name (like "Follow-ups" or "Incidents").

## Workload metrics

### Calculating workload

We generate workload by watching activity taken in an incident — inferring activity as a signal that someone was actively working on that incident.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Activity Rules">
    **Rule 1: Initial activity detection**
    
    If we see incident activity, such as a message in the incident channel, or work in integrations like issue trackers, we'll assume the related person has spent 10 minutes working on this incident.
    
    **Rule 2: Continuous activity**
    
    If the same user takes another action for the same incident within 20 minutes of the last, we'll assume they've been working on this incident continuously since the last time we saw them.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Example Calculation">
    **Scenario:** Tracking workload for a single responder
    
    - **10:11 AM** - User messages incident channel
      - Assigned: 10 minutes of workload
    
    - **10:15 AM** - User updates Zendesk ticket
      - Adjusted: 4 minutes of activity (10:11 to 10:15)
      - Added: 10 more minutes after
      - **Total:** 14 minutes of work
    
    When we have access to participant data, we also include being a participant in an incident call as workload.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Incident Manager Adjustment">
    For incident managers who work across many incidents at a time, we apply a final calculation to trim their workload to ensure we never overlap workloads across incidents.
    
    This prevents us from calculating more than one hour of work in any hour, ensuring accurate representation of their actual capacity.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

<Check>
We're confident this calculation is representative of individual contributions and can be used as a valuable proxy for effort put into an incident.

### Calculating working hours

The workload chart splits hours by time of day to understand when work is happening:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Working hours" icon="sun">
    **8 AM - 7 PM**
    
    Standard working hours in the user's timezone
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Late hours" icon="moon">
    **7 PM - 11 PM**
    
    Evening hours outside typical work time
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Sleeping hours" icon="bed">
    **11 PM - 8 AM**
    
    Overnight hours when work is most disruptive
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

This is a dimension we apply to the calculated workload to understand when a period of work happened relative to the user's timezone, which we align with their Slack timezone at the point this workload is seen to have occurred.

<Info>
**Note:** Working hours are not customizable.
