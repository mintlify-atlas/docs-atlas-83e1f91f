## What are workflows?

Workflows allow you to automate actions and behaviors based on specific triggers during incident response. Instead of manually inviting people, posting updates, creating tasks, or escalating issues, workflows handle these repetitive actions automatically - ensuring consistency and speed.

<Info>
**From manual to automated**

Without workflows: Every time a critical incident occurs, someone manually pages the on-call engineer, posts to the exec channel, invites stakeholders, and creates follow-up tasks.

With workflows: These actions happen automatically and consistently, every time.
</Info>

## How workflows work

Every workflow has three key components:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Trigger: What starts the workflow">
    A trigger is an event that causes the workflow to run. Available triggers:
    
    - **Incident created or changed** - When incidents are declared or updated
    - **Someone joins incident channel** - When a new person enters the channel
    - **Message posted in incident channel** - When messages are sent
    - **Custom field changes** - When specific field values are updated
    - **Severity changes** - When incident severity is modified
    - **Status changes** - When incident status updates
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Conditions: When should it run">
    Conditions control which incidents or users trigger the workflow. Without conditions, the workflow runs for ALL events.
    
    **Example conditions:**
    - Only for Critical or High severity incidents
    - Only when Affected Service is "Payments"
    - Only for incidents where you're the incident lead
    - Only for messages containing specific text
    
    You can combine multiple conditions with AND/OR logic.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Steps: What actions to take">
    Steps are the actions executed when conditions are met. You can add up to 20 steps per workflow.
    
    **Common step types:**
    - Send message to Slack channel
    - Send direct message to users
    - Invite users to incident channel
    - Escalate to PagerDuty/Opsgenie
    - Create incident actions or follow-ups
    - Prompt a Decision Flow
    - Update custom fields
    - Send webhooks
    - Create loops to repeat actions
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common workflow patterns

### Automatic escalation

**Scenario:** Page the right on-call engineer based on affected service

```
Trigger: Incident is created
Condition: Severity is High or Critical
Steps:
  1. Use expression: Affected Service → Owning Team → Escalation Policy
  2. Escalate to PagerDuty using the escalation policy
  3. Send DM to incident lead confirming escalation
```

**Result:** Critical incidents automatically page the correct team's on-call without manual lookup.

### Executive notifications

**Scenario:** Notify leadership of high-severity incidents

```
Trigger: Incident severity changes
Condition: New severity is Critical
Steps:
  1. Post incident summary to #exec-incidents
  2. Send DM to VP Engineering
  3. If Affected Customers includes VIP customers:
     - Notify CEO
```

**Result:** Leadership is immediately aware of critical incidents with appropriate context.

### Customer impact management

**Scenario:** Notify account managers when their customers are affected

```
Trigger: Incident is created or Affected Customers field changes
Condition: Affected Customers is set
Steps:
  1. Create loop over Affected Customers
  2. For each customer:
     - Send DM to customer's Account Manager
     - Include incident details and expected impact
  3. If customer tier is Enterprise:
     - Post to #customer-success-escalations
```

**Result:** Account managers are proactively notified so they can manage customer communications.

### Onboarding and guidance

**Scenario:** Help new incident leads with decision points

```
Trigger: Someone joins incident channel
Condition: User is in "New Incident Leads" group
Steps:
  1. Send DM with incident lead cheat sheet
  2. Post reminder about key resources in incident channel
  3. After 5 minutes:
     - Prompt decision flow: "Do you need help?"
```

**Result:** New incident leads get contextual help without asking.

### Automatic follow-ups

**Scenario:** Create standard follow-up tasks based on severity

```
Trigger: Incident status changes to "Resolved"
Condition: Severity was High or Critical
Steps:
  1. Create follow-up: "Schedule incident review meeting"
  2. Create follow-up: "Document root cause"
  3. Create follow-up: "Update runbooks"
  4. Assign follow-ups to incident lead
```

**Result:** Important post-incident tasks are never forgotten.

## Using Catalog with workflows

Workflows become dramatically more powerful when combined with [Catalog](/product-documentation/catalog/overview) data:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Expressions">
    Navigate catalog relationships to derive values:
    
    ```
    Affected Service → Owning Team → Slack Channel
    ```
    
    Use this to post messages to the team's channel automatically.
    
    Learn more: [Workflow Expressions](/product-documentation/workflows/workflow-expressions)
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Conditional logic">
    Make decisions based on catalog attributes:
    
    ```
    If Affected Service → Tier is "Critical Infrastructure"
      Then escalate to Director
    Else
      Escalate to Manager
    ```
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Loops">
    Iterate over multi-valued catalog fields:
    
    ```
    For each Team in Affected Teams:
      - Page the team's escalation policy
      - Post to the team's Slack channel
    ```

## Building your first workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Workflows">
    Open [Workflows](https://app.incident.io/workflows) in your dashboard
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose a starting point">
    **Option A: Start from template**
    - Browse pre-built templates
    - Click "Start from this template"
    - Customize to your needs
    
    **Option B: Start from scratch**
    - Click "New workflow"
    - Choose your trigger
    - Build from the ground up
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure the trigger">
    Select what event should start this workflow:
    - Incident created/changed
    - User joins channel
    - Message posted
    - Field changed
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add conditions (optional)">
    Click "Add condition" to filter when the workflow runs:
    - Select a field (Severity, Status, Custom Fields)
    - Choose an operator (is one of, contains, is set)
    - Pick values
    
    Add multiple conditions with AND/OR logic.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add steps">
    Click "Add a step" to define actions:
    
    1. Choose step type (message, escalation, etc.)
    2. Configure the step:
       - For messages: write content, select channel
       - For escalations: select policy
       - For invites: select users or groups
    3. Use "Use variable" to insert dynamic values
    4. Create expressions for advanced logic
    
    Drag and drop to reorder steps.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Name your workflow">
    Give it a descriptive name like:
    - ✅ "Escalate critical payments incidents to on-call"
    - ❌ "Workflow 1"
    
    The name appears in Slack when the workflow posts.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test your workflow">
    Click "Test" and select a test incident:
    - Choose an incident that matches your conditions
    - Select a user if your trigger involves users
    - Review the test results
    
    **Important:** Testing will actually execute steps (send messages, create follow-ups, etc.). Use a test incident!
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save and enable">
    - **"Save as draft"** - Save without enabling (for testing)
    - **"Save and set live"** - Enable the workflow immediately
    
    Once live, the workflow runs automatically for matching events.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
**Use test incidents**

Create a [test incident](https://app.incident.io) specifically for testing workflows. This prevents accidental messages, pages, or notifications during development.
</Note>

## Dynamic values and variables

Workflows use dynamic values to personalize actions:

### Built-in variables

Available in any workflow:

- **Incident attributes:** Severity, Status, Incident Lead, Summary, Slack Channel
- **Custom fields:** Any custom field value
- **User attributes:** Name, Email, Slack handle (for user-triggered workflows)
- **Timestamps:** Incident created at, updated at

### Catalog expressions

Navigate catalog relationships:

- `Affected Service → Owning Team`
- `Affected Customer → Account Manager`
- `Affected Service → Monitoring Dashboard URL`

See [Workflow Expressions](/product-documentation/workflows/workflow-expressions) for details.

### Conditional expressions

Return different values based on conditions:

```
If Severity is Critical:
  Return: #critical-incidents
Else if Severity is High:
  Return: #high-incidents
Else:
  Return: #all-incidents
```

## Workflow management

### Viewing workflow runs

Monitor workflow execution:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open workflow details">
    Click the workflow name in the Workflows list
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click 'Activity' tab">
    View the run history with:
    - When the workflow ran
    - Which incident triggered it
    - Whether it succeeded or failed
    - Error messages (if any)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Debug issues">
    Click individual runs to see:
    - Step-by-step execution
    - Values used in each step
    - Why steps were skipped
    - Error details
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Editing workflows

<Note>
**You cannot change the trigger**

If you need a different trigger, create a new workflow. All other aspects can be edited.
</Note>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the workflow">
    Click the workflow name
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Make changes">
    Modify:
    - Name and description
    - Conditions
    - Steps (add, remove, reorder)
    - Step configuration
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test changes">
    Use the "Test" button to verify modifications
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save">
    Click "Save" - changes apply to future workflow runs immediately
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Deleting workflows

<Warning>
**Deletion is permanent**

Deleted workflows cannot be restored. Consider setting to "Draft" instead if you might need it later.
</Warning>

1. Open the workflow
2. Click the "..." menu
3. Select "Delete workflow"
4. Confirm deletion

## Advanced features

### Loops

Repeat steps for each item in a multi-valued field:

```
Create loop over: Affected Services
For each service:
  1. Post to service's Slack channel
  2. Page service's on-call
```

Loops automatically "catch up" - if the field changes, the loop runs only for new values.

Learn more: [Using loops in workflows](/help-centre/configure-your-account/workflows/using-loops-in-workflows)

### Decision Flows

Prompt responders to make decisions:

```
Step: Prompt decision flow: "Should we engage external comms?"
Options: Yes / No

Next workflow (triggered on decision):
Condition: Decision was "Yes"
Step: Invite communications team
```

### Webhooks

Integrate with external systems:

```
Step: Send webhook
URL: https://api.example.com/incidents
Method: POST
Body: {
  "incident_id": "{Incident ID}",
  "severity": "{Severity}",
  "affected_service": "{Affected Service}"
}
```

Learn more: [Sending webhooks from workflows](/help-centre/configure-your-account/workflows/sending-a-webhook-from-a-workflow)

### Terraform management

Manage workflows as code:

```hcl
resource "incident_workflow" "escalate_critical" {
  name = "Escalate critical incidents"
  trigger = "incident.created"
  
  condition {
    subject = "incident.severity"
    operation = "one_of"
    values = ["critical"]
  }
  
  step {
    type = "escalate_pagerduty"
    # ... configuration
  }
}
```

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start simple, iterate" icon="seedling">
    Begin with one high-value workflow:
    - Critical incident escalation
    - Executive notifications
    - Customer impact alerts
    
    Perfect it, measure impact, then add more.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use descriptive names" icon="tag">
    Good names explain:
    - **When** it runs: "On critical incident creation..."
    - **What** it does: "...escalate to engineering on-call"
    
    Bad names: "Workflow 1", "Test", "New Workflow"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test thoroughly" icon="vial">
    Before setting live:
    - Test with realistic incidents
    - Verify messages format correctly
    - Check that expressions return expected values
    - Confirm correct people are notified
    - Test edge cases (empty fields, multiple values)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Monitor workflow runs" icon="chart-line">
    Regularly review:
    - Are workflows running when expected?
    - Are there failures or errors?
    - Are steps being skipped unexpectedly?
    - Is the workflow still relevant?
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Avoid notification fatigue" icon="bell-slash">
    Be judicious with messages and escalations:
    - Use conditions to target appropriately
    - Don't duplicate information
    - Consolidate multiple notifications
    - Provide opt-out mechanisms for sensitive incidents
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Document complex workflows" icon="book">
    For workflows with intricate logic:
    - Add comments explaining why decisions were made
    - Document expected behavior
    - Note any quirks or edge cases
    - Keep runbooks for troubleshooting
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use templates wisely" icon="clone">
    Templates provide great starting points but:
    - Customize to your organization
    - Remove unnecessary steps
    - Adjust conditions to your severity levels
    - Update placeholder text and channels
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Workflow not running" icon="play-slash">
    **Check:**
    - Is the workflow set to "Live" (not "Draft")?
    - Do the conditions match the incident?
    - Is the trigger configured correctly?
    - Look at Activity tab for "Skipped" runs
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Step failing" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Check:**
    - Are all required fields populated?
    - Are expressions returning valid values?
    - Do integrations (PagerDuty, etc.) have correct credentials?
    - Look at error message in Activity tab
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Expression returning nothing" icon="empty-set">
    **Check:**
    - Is the source field set on the incident?
    - Does the catalog relationship exist?
    - Is the target attribute populated?
    - Navigate the expression path manually in Catalog
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Too many workflow runs" icon="bolt">
    **Cause:** Workflow triggers on "changed" and field updates frequently
    
    **Solution:**
    - Make conditions more specific
    - Use "once per incident" trigger option
    - Check for loops (workflow updates field that triggers itself)
