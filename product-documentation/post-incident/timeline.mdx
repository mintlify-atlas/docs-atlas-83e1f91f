# Timeline

Post-mortems are a best practice and incredibly useful. Good post-mortems rely on someone building a clear and cohesive timeline of the incident.

But it can become a real nightmare to retroactively parse through hundreds of Slack messages, screenshots, Sentry errors, GitHub PRs/commits etc. to get a clear picture of what happened.

**While your incident is playing out and you're focused on fixing, incident.io acts as your scribe, capturing and organizing key events for you.**

## Accessing the timeline

You can find an incident's timeline on the **Timeline** tab of the incident homepage.

The timeline provides a chronological view of all significant events during the incident, from declaration through resolution.

## What's automatically captured

incident.io automatically creates timeline events from:

- **Incident updates** - Severity changes, status changes, role assignments
- **Pinned Slack messages** - Any message pinned in the incident channel
- **Role changes** - When responders are assigned or unassigned from roles
- **Summary updates** - Changes to the incident summary
- **Actions** - Created, assigned, or updated actions
- **Pull requests and commits** - GitHub activity related to the incident
- **Errors** - Sentry errors and exceptions
- **Images** - Screenshots and graphs shared in the channel
- **Escalations** - Who was paged, when they acknowledged, and when they joined

<Info>
Items pinned to the channel are timestamped at their original posting time, not when they were pinned. Don't worry if you forgot to pin items in the heat of the moment - they'll be positioned correctly on the timeline.
</Info>

## Editing the timeline

While incident.io captures key moments automatically, you'll often want to add context or include additional events.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the timeline editor">
    Navigate to the incident's Timeline tab and click the **Edit** button.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review captured events">
    The right panel shows your current timeline. The left panel shows the complete activity log of all detected events during the incident.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Edit existing events">
    Click the pencil icon next to any timeline event to edit its title or add a description. Use descriptions to provide context about why something happened or what it meant for the incident.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add additional events">
    Add events from the activity log, pin new Slack messages, or create custom events for things that happened outside the incident channel.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Adding events to the timeline

### From the activity log

The activity log in the timeline editor shows every event detected during the incident. If any events are important to the narrative, add them by clicking the plus icon.

Available event types include:
- Role changes
- Updates to the incident summary
- Actions (created, assigned, updated)
- Pull requests and commits in GitHub
- Errors in Sentry
- Images posted in the channel

### Pinning messages from Slack

While in an incident's channel, use the pin emoji or Slack's built-in "Pin to channel" command on any message, screenshot, or graph to add it to the timeline.

Anything pinned automatically appears on the timeline with the correct timestamp.

### Adding custom events

If an event happened outside the incident channel (like a code deployment or customer message), you can add it as a custom event:

1. Click **Add custom event** in the timeline editor
2. Provide the timestamp when it occurred
3. Add a title describing what happened
4. Optionally add a description with more detail

Custom events are useful for:
- External system changes (deployments, configuration updates)
- Customer communications
- Events from monitoring systems not integrated with incident.io
- Off-Slack conversations or decisions

## Using the timeline

### Creating post-mortems

Once you've curated your timeline, create a post-mortem in your document provider (Notion, Google Docs, Confluence). incident.io renders a copy of the timeline in your document automatically.

The timeline forms the factual backbone of your post-mortem, providing:
- Accurate timestamps for all key events
- Links to relevant Slack messages, PRs, and errors
- Visual elements like graphs and screenshots
- A clear sequence of what happened

### Starting discussions

You can start discussions about particular events on the timeline. This is useful when:
- There's ambiguity about why something happened
- You want to gather feedback before the debrief
- You need to capture important context while it's fresh

To add a comment, hover over an event and click the comment icon. Your comment notifies other responders who have been following the incident.

### Reviewing for accuracy

Before finalizing a post-mortem, review the timeline to ensure:
- All critical events are included
- Timestamps are accurate
- Events are in the correct order
- Descriptions provide helpful context
- Sensitive information is appropriately handled

## Timeline best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Pin liberally during the incident">
    Encourage responders to pin important messages as they happen. It's easier to remove unnecessary items later than to hunt for important messages in a busy channel.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Add context soon after resolution">
    Edit the timeline shortly after resolving the incident while details are fresh. Add descriptions to events explaining their significance.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Include the 'why' not just the 'what'">
    Timeline events should capture not just what happened but why decisions were made. This context is invaluable for learning and future incidents.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Capture external events">
    Don't limit your timeline to what happened in Slack. Add custom events for deployments, customer reports, and off-Slack decisions.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Use images effectively">
    Screenshots of graphs, error messages, and system states provide valuable visual context. Make sure key images are included in the timeline.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Editing after closure

<Note>
You can edit the timeline even after an incident is closed. Add your own narrative or events that happened in external systems at any time.
</Note>

This flexibility allows you to:
- Correct inaccuracies discovered during debrief preparation
- Add events discovered later in log analysis
- Incorporate feedback from team members
- Refine the narrative for clarity

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I delete events from the timeline?">
    Yes. In the timeline editor, you can remove events that aren't relevant to the incident narrative. This helps focus the timeline on what truly mattered.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens to pinned messages if I unpin them in Slack?">
    Events added to the timeline from pinned messages remain on the timeline even if you later unpin the message in Slack. The timeline is independent of the current pin state.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I reorder timeline events?">
    Timeline events are ordered by their timestamp. To change the order, edit the timestamp of the event. This is useful if you discover the actual time of an event was different than initially recorded.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How far back can I add custom events?">
    You can add custom events with timestamps before the incident was declared. This is useful for capturing precursor events or root causes that occurred before anyone realized there was an incident.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Integration highlights

### GitHub
Pull requests, commits, and deployments related to the incident are automatically tracked on the timeline, giving you a clear view of code changes during the incident.

### Sentry
Errors and exceptions are automatically added to the timeline, helping you correlate error spikes with other incident events.

### Datadog
Datadog monitors that trigger can be pinned to the timeline. Paste links to Datadog snapshots in Slack and pin the message to include the graph directly in your timeline.

### PagerDuty
PagerDuty incident information can be pulled onto your timeline, showing when alerts fired and who was paged.
