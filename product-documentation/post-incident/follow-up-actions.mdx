# Follow-up action creation and tracking

During and after incidents, you'll identify two types of tasks: those that **need doing now** to resolve the incident, and those that should be **followed up after** the incident is closed.

Follow-ups capture improvements, documentation updates, and preventive measures that emerge from incidents. incident.io helps you create, track, and complete these actions so insights translate into actual improvements.

## Actions vs. Follow-ups

**Actions** are urgent tasks during active incident response:
- Restart the server
- Contact an affected customer
- Roll back the deployment

**Follow-ups** are improvements to make after the incident:
- Improve test coverage of a codepath
- Update runbook documentation
- Add monitoring for edge cases
- Share the debrief with affected customers

<Info>
When you resolve an incident with open actions, incident.io prompts you to convert them to follow-ups. This ensures important work doesn't get lost in the transition from active response to post-incident.

## Creating follow-ups

There are multiple ways to create follow-ups during and after an incident.

### From Slack messages

React with the `:fast_forward:` emoji to any Slack message in the incident channel. The message is captured as a follow-up with its context preserved.

This is the fastest way to capture follow-ups during the chaos of incident response.

### Using the /inc command

Type `/inc follow-up` in the incident channel to:
- Create a new follow-up with a title and description
- View all open follow-ups for the incident
- Update existing follow-ups

### From external issue trackers

Create the follow-up directly in your issue tracker (Jira, Linear, GitHub, etc.) and paste the link into the Slack channel. incident.io automatically creates a linked follow-up.

This is useful when you already have a ticket or want to ensure the follow-up is immediately tracked in your team's workflow.

### From the incident dashboard

In the incident homepage, go to the Follow-ups tab and click **Add follow-up**. Provide a title, description, and optional assignee.

### AI-suggested follow-ups

incident.io's AI can analyze your incident and suggest relevant follow-ups based on:
- Conversation in the incident channel
- Similar past incidents
- Common improvement patterns

Review AI suggestions and add the ones that make sense for your incident.

## Managing follow-ups

### Assigning priorities

Set the priority for each follow-up to communicate urgency and drive policy enforcement.

**Configure priorities in Settings → Follow-ups:**
- Whether follow-ups require a priority
- Available priority options (e.g., Urgent, High, Medium, Low)
- Names and descriptions of each priority
- Default priority for new follow-ups

Set priority via the dropdown in the web dashboard or Slack.

<Note>
Priorities integrate with policies to enforce different SLAs. For example: "Urgent follow-ups must be completed within 3 days, medium priority within 10 days."
</Note>

### Editing follow-ups

If a follow-up is exported to an external issue tracker, incident.io listens for changes and syncs updates:
- Title changes
- Status updates
- Assignee changes
- Completion

If not exported, manage the follow-up via:
- `/inc follow-ups` in Slack
- The Follow-ups tab on the incident homepage

### Tracking status

Follow-ups have configurable statuses that reflect progress:
- **Outstanding** - Not yet started
- **In Progress** - Actively being worked on
- **Completed** - Finished
- **Cancelled** - No longer relevant

Customize statuses in **Settings → Follow-ups** to match your workflow.

## Exporting follow-ups

Export follow-ups to your issue tracking system to centralize work and ensure follow-ups don't get forgotten.

### Manual export

From the incident homepage or Slack:

1. Select follow-ups to export
2. Choose the destination (Jira, Linear, GitHub, etc.)
3. Configure fields like project, assignee, and labels
4. Export

incident.io syncs status between the exported ticket and the follow-up, so you can work in your issue tracker without manually updating incident.io.

### Export templates

Create export templates to pre-configure field values:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Settings → Follow-ups">
    Go to the Follow-ups settings page.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add an export template">
    Click **Add export template** and select your issue tracker.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure default values">
    Set defaults for:
    - Project or repository
    - Assignee
    - Labels or tags
    - Priority mapping
    - Issue type
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save the template">
    Give the template a descriptive name so responders know when to use it.
  </Step>
</Steps>

When exporting follow-ups, you can select a template to apply its configuration automatically.

### Auto-exporting follow-ups

Eliminate manual export by configuring automatic export rules.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up integrations">
    Ensure your issue tracker is installed in **Settings → Integrations**.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure export templates">
    Create export templates for different teams or incident types.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Enable auto-export">
    In **Settings → Follow-ups**, enable auto-export.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure conditions">
    Add conditions to determine which follow-ups export automatically and which template to use.
    
    Example: "If incident's Affected Team is ProductOps, automatically export to ProductOps Jira project."
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set fallback behavior">
    Choose whether to:
    - Not export if conditions don't match
    - Use a default template for all other incidents
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
By default, auto-export is disabled for private incidents. You can enable it in **Settings → Follow-ups** if needed.
</Note>

### Bulk export

From the Follow-ups reporting page, you can bulk-export multiple follow-ups at once:

1. Filter for the follow-ups you want to export
2. Select the follow-ups
3. Click **Bulk export**
4. Choose the destination and template
5. Export all selected follow-ups

## Tracking follow-ups

### Follow-ups dashboard

Access the [Follow-ups page](https://app.incident.io/follow-ups) to see all follow-ups across all incidents.

**Filter by:**
- Status (Outstanding, Completed, etc.)
- Priority (Urgent, High, Medium, Low)
- Assignee
- Incident attributes (severity, affected services, etc.)
- Export status
- Date ranges

**Available actions:**
- Send reminders to assignees
- Bulk-edit follow-ups
- Bulk-export to issue trackers
- Generate reports

### Saved views

Create saved views for frequently used filters:
- "My outstanding follow-ups"
- "Urgent follow-ups from major incidents"
- "Follow-ups not exported to Jira"
- "Follow-ups overdue for completion"

Saved views are shared with your organization, making it easy for everyone to track relevant follow-ups.

### Reporting and analytics

Use the Follow-ups page to analyze trends:

**Split by dimensions:**
- Follow-up priority
- Assigned team
- Incident severity
- Time to completion

**View metrics:**
- Total follow-ups created
- Completion rate
- Average time to completion
- Overdue follow-ups

These insights help you understand whether incidents are leading to meaningful improvements.

## Workflows with follow-ups

Use workflows to automate follow-up management.

### Common workflow patterns

**Notify on urgent follow-ups:**
When a follow-up is created with Urgent priority, send a notification to the engineering leads.

**Auto-assign by team:**
When a follow-up is created for an incident affecting the payments service, automatically assign it to the payments team lead.

**Reminder escalation:**
When a follow-up is overdue by 3 days, send a reminder to the assignee. If still not completed after 7 days, notify their manager.

**Slack updates:**
When a follow-up is completed, post a message to the team's Slack channel celebrating the improvement.

Configure workflows in **Settings → Workflows** using the "When a follow-up is created or changed" trigger.

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Capture follow-ups during the incident">
    Don't wait until the post-mortem to identify follow-ups. React with :fast_forward: to messages in real-time so insights aren't lost.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Make follow-ups specific and actionable">
    Instead of "improve monitoring," write "add alert for API latency > 500ms on /checkout endpoint." Specific follow-ups are more likely to get completed.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Assign an owner">
    Follow-ups without owners often never get done. Assign someone responsible for seeing the work through to completion.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Set appropriate priorities">
    Not all follow-ups are equally important. Use priorities to focus effort on high-impact improvements while tracking lower-priority work for later.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Review follow-ups regularly">
    Make follow-up review a regular team practice. Discuss progress, reprioritize, and close or update stale follow-ups.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Measure completion">
    Track follow-up completion rates. If completion is low, investigate why. Common issues include unclear ownership, lack of time, or follow-ups that aren't actually valuable.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens to actions that aren't completed when I resolve the incident?">
    When you resolve an incident with open actions, incident.io prompts you to convert them to follow-ups. This ensures important work continues after resolution.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I create follow-ups for closed incidents?">
    Yes. You can add follow-ups to any incident at any time, even after it's closed. This is useful when you discover improvements during post-mortem analysis.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Do follow-ups sync bidirectionally with issue trackers?">
    Yes. Changes in your issue tracker (status, assignee, completion) sync back to incident.io automatically. You can work in your preferred tool without double-updating.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I have different auto-export rules for different teams?">
    Yes. Configure multiple conditions in auto-export settings, each with its own export template. Match incidents to the right team's issue tracker automatically.
