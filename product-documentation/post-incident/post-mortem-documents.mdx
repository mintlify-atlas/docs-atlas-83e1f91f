## Overview

Post-mortem documents help you understand what happened during an incident, identify systemic issues, and prevent future occurrences. incident.io provides multiple ways to create post-mortems, from fully integrated in-house documents to exports to external providers.

<Info>
Good post-mortems require gathering context from multiple sources: Slack threads, logs, monitoring, and more. incident.io brings all this information together at your fingertips.

  </Step>
  <Step title="In progress">
    Post-mortem is being written. Auto-completed when you start editing.
  </Step>
  <Step title="In review">
    Draft is complete and ready for team review. Use comments to gather feedback.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Completed">
    Post-mortem is finalized and approved. Some post-incident flow tasks auto-complete at this stage.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Shared">

## Exporting post-mortems

Even when writing in incident.io, you can export a copy for archival:

1. Click **Export** at the top of the post-mortem
2. Choose your destination (Confluence, Notion, Google Docs)
3. All sections are moved to the external document
4. Follow-ups and timeline remain visible in incident.io

<video controls>
  <source src="/videos/exporting-post-mortem.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<Warning>
**Pro tip:** Export *after* your debrief meeting to ensure you're exporting the most up-to-date version with all feedback incorporated.

A formatted message is posted to each channel with:

  <Card title="Write promptly" icon="clock">
    Complete post-mortems while the incident is fresh in memory. Set due dates in your post-incident flow.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Be specific" icon="crosshairs">

    Lessons learned benefit the entire organization. Don't keep insights siloed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Track follow-ups" icon="list-check">
