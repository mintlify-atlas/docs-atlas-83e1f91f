# Post-mortem documents

Writing post-mortems is an incredibly valuable process. It forces writers to understand what actually happened during an incident, and a good post-mortem document can reveal the systemic issues hidden behind surface-level problems.

Rather than spending hours gathering context from various sources, incident.io automatically assembles incident information into a structured post-mortem document that you can edit, collaborate on, and export.

## Creating a post-mortem

You can create a post-mortem for any resolved incident.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the incident">
    Open the incident homepage for the resolved incident.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click 'Create post-mortem'">
    In the Post-mortem section on the right side of the page, click **Create post-mortem**.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose your editing method">
    Select one of three options:
    - **Use the collaborative editor** - Edit directly in incident.io with real-time collaboration
    - **Export to external provider** - Send to Google Docs, Notion, or Confluence
    - **Copy to clipboard** - Paste into any editor of your choice
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
Right now, you can only generate a post-mortem for resolved incidents. This ensures the timeline and incident details are complete.

<Note>
Collaborative post-mortems can be deleted from the menu, allowing you to iterate on templates. Deletion removes all versions permanently and cannot be undone.
</Note>

## Exporting to external providers

Export post-mortems to your existing documentation tools to collaborate where your team already works.

### Supported integrations

#### Google Docs

1. Install the Google Docs integration
2. Configure a destination folder in **Settings → Post-mortem**
3. Navigate to your Google Drive folder and copy its URL
4. Paste the URL in the destination configuration

When creating a post-mortem, select Google Docs as the destination. incident.io creates the document in your configured folder and links it to the incident.

#### Confluence

1. Install the Confluence integration
2. In **Settings → Post-mortem**, add Confluence as a destination
3. Select a parent page where post-mortems will be created as child pages
4. Create multiple destinations for different teams or services

When exporting, choose the appropriate destination based on the incident's team or service.

#### Notion

1. Install the Notion integration
2. Configure your workspace connection
3. Create a post-mortem from the incident timeline
4. The post-mortem document is created in Notion and linked to the incident page

### Copy to clipboard

For tools without native integrations:

1. Click **Create post-mortem**
2. Select **Copy to Clipboard**
3. Paste into your editor of choice

This works in most modern editors including:
- Google Docs
- Notion
- Confluence
- Jira
- Slab
- Microsoft Word

Formatting is preserved during paste, including headings, lists, and basic styling.

## Customizing post-mortem templates

Every team has different post-mortem practices. Customize templates to match your workflow.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access template settings">
    Navigate to **Settings → Post-mortem**.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create or edit a template">
    Create a new template or edit an existing one.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Customize sections">
    Configure:
    - Template name
    - Section names and order
    - Section content and prompts
    - Variables for document naming
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set default behavior">
    Choose whether to:
    - Export immediately to an external provider
    - Use the collaborative editor
    - Prompt the user to choose
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Template variables

Use variables in templates to automatically populate information:

- `{{incident.name}}` - Incident name
- `{{incident.severity}}` - Severity level
- `{{incident.started_at}}` - Start timestamp
- `{{incident.resolved_at}}` - Resolution timestamp
- Custom field values

### Multiple templates

Create different templates for:
- Different severity levels (major vs. minor incidents)
- Different teams (engineering, customer support, etc.)
- Different incident types (security, performance, outage)
- Different documentation standards (internal vs. external)

## Attaching and sharing post-mortems

### Attaching external documents

If you created a post-mortem outside incident.io:

1. Click **Attach** in the Post-mortem export form
2. Paste the URL to your external document
3. The document is now linked to the incident

Attached documents:
- Appear in the incident's post-mortem section
- Are accessible from the incident homepage
- Can be marked as complete for post-incident tasks

### Marking as complete

Once your post-mortem is finished:

1. Click **Mark as complete** on the incident homepage
2. This completes the "Mark post-mortem as complete" task in the post-incident flow
3. The incident can progress to the next post-incident phase

### Sharing post-mortems

Share completed post-mortems with your team:

1. From the incident homepage, click **Share to Slack**
2. Select which channels should receive the post-mortem
3. Add a message providing context
4. The post-mortem is posted with a link to the full document

Sharing automatically completes the "Share the debrief document" task in your post-incident flow.

## Post-mortem best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Focus on systems, not people">
    Good post-mortems examine systemic issues, not individual actions. Frame discussions around "what can we improve" rather than "who made a mistake."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Be specific about improvements">
    Instead of vague statements like "improve monitoring," write specific follow-ups like "add alerting for queue depth > 1000 on the processing service."
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Include the good and the bad">
    Document what went well in addition to what went wrong. Understanding why response was effective helps replicate success.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Write while it's fresh">
    Create the post-mortem within days of the incident, not weeks. Details fade quickly from memory.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Make it skimmable">
    Use clear headings, bullet points, and summaries. Many readers will skim for key learnings and follow-ups.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Integration with post-incident flow

Post-mortem creation integrates seamlessly with your post-incident workflow:

- **"Create the post-mortem document" task** - Automatically completed when you create or attach a post-mortem
- **"Mark the post-mortem document as complete" task** - Completed when you mark the post-mortem as done
- **"Export the post-mortem" task** - Ensures external export happens before closure
- **"Share the debrief document" task** - Completed when you share to Slack

Configure which tasks are required for your post-incident flow in **Settings → Improve → Post-incident flow**.

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I edit a post-mortem after exporting?">
    Yes. Changes made in external tools (Google Docs, Notion, Confluence) don't sync back to incident.io, but you can freely edit the external document. The link to the document remains attached to the incident.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens to the timeline in the post-mortem?">
    The incident timeline is rendered in your post-mortem document automatically. It includes timestamps, events, and descriptions. Any edits to the timeline in incident.io won't update already-exported documents.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I have different templates for different teams?">
    Yes. Create multiple templates and multiple export destinations. When creating a post-mortem, you can choose which template and destination to use.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I set a default template?">
    In **Settings → Post-mortem**, mark one template as the default. This template will be pre-selected when creating post-mortems, though users can still choose a different template.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
