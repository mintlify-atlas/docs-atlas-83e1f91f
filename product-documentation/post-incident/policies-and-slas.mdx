# Policies and SLAs

Policies help your organization define rules about how post-incident work should be completed. By setting clear expectations and SLAs, you ensure that insights from incidents translate into timely improvements rather than getting lost in the backlog.

## Overview

Policies in incident.io let you:
- Define SLAs for follow-up completion
- Set requirements based on incident attributes
- Use different SLAs for different priorities or severities
- Track policy violations and adherence
- Send notifications when policies are at risk

Policies create accountability for post-incident work without requiring manual tracking.

## Understanding policies

### Policy types

incident.io supports policies for:
- **Follow-ups** - Require follow-ups to be completed within a timeframe
- **Post-mortem creation** - Ensure post-mortems are written for qualifying incidents
- **Debrief scheduling** - Require debriefs to be scheduled within a timeframe
- **Custom requirements** - Define organization-specific requirements

### Policy components

Each policy consists of:

1. **Scope** - Which incidents or follow-ups does this apply to?
2. **Requirements** - What needs to be done?
3. **SLA** - How quickly must it be done?
4. **Actions** - What happens when the policy is violated or at risk?

## Creating follow-up policies

Follow-up policies ensure that action items from incidents are completed in a timely manner.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to policy settings">
    Go to [Settings → Policies](https://app.incident.io/~/settings/policies) and click **New Policy**.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select policy type">
    Choose **Follow-ups** as the policy type.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Name and describe the policy">
    Give the policy a clear name like "Urgent follow-up completion" and describe what it enforces.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Define the scope">
    Add conditions to determine which follow-ups this policy applies to. For example:
    - All follow-ups from major incidents
    - Follow-ups with Urgent priority
    - Follow-ups assigned to specific teams
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set the SLA">
    Define how many days after incident resolution follow-ups must be completed. You can use a fixed number or an expression for dynamic SLAs.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Define requirements">
    Specify what "completed" means. For example:
    - Follow-up status is not Outstanding
    - Follow-up is marked as Done or Cancelled
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure notifications">
    Set up notifications for when the policy is at risk or violated.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example: Priority-based follow-up SLAs

Create a policy where SLA varies by follow-up priority:

**Configuration:**
- **Name:** "Priority-based follow-up completion"
- **SLA days:** Use an expression:
  - If Follow-up → Priority is Urgent, return `3`
  - If Follow-up → Priority is High, return `7`
  - If Follow-up → Priority is Medium, return `14`
  - Otherwise, return `30`
- **Requirements:** Follow-up → Status is not Outstanding

This policy gives you 3 days for urgent follow-ups, 7 for high priority, 14 for medium, and 30 for low priority.

<Info>
Using expressions for SLAs allows sophisticated logic based on incident severity, follow-up priority, affected services, or any custom field.
</Info>

## Using expressions in policies

Expressions make policies flexible and context-aware.

### Common expression patterns

**Severity-based SLAs:**
```
If Incident → Severity is Critical, return 1
If Incident → Severity is Major, return 3
Otherwise, return 7
```

**Team-based SLAs:**
```
If Incident → Affected Team is Security, return 2
If Incident → Affected Team is Platform, return 5
Otherwise, return 10
```

**Custom field-based SLAs:**
```
If Incident → Customer Impacting is Yes, return 3
Otherwise, return 14
```

**Combined conditions:**
```
If Incident → Severity is Critical AND Follow-up → Priority is Urgent, return 1
If Incident → Severity is Critical, return 3
If Follow-up → Priority is Urgent, return 5
Otherwise, return 14
```

### SLA calculation start point

For follow-up policies, the SLA typically starts from:
- Incident resolution time
- Follow-up creation time
- Custom expression-based start time

Configure which event triggers the SLA countdown in your policy settings.

## Policy enforcement

### Policy states

Policies can be in several states:

**Adhering**
The policy is being met. Requirements are fulfilled within the SLA.

**At risk**
The policy hasn't been violated yet, but the deadline is approaching. This state helps teams take action before violation.

**Violated**
The SLA deadline has passed and requirements aren't met.

**N/A**
The policy doesn't apply to this incident or follow-up based on scope conditions.

### Notifications

Configure notifications for policy state changes:

**At-risk notifications:**
- Send when X% of SLA time has elapsed
- Notify the assignee, incident lead, or custom users
- Include a link to the incident or follow-up

**Violation notifications:**
- Send when SLA is exceeded
- Escalate to managers or team leads
- Post to Slack channels for visibility

**Pro and Enterprise plans** support automatic reminders, ensuring teams stay on top of post-incident work.

## Tracking policy adherence

### Policy dashboard

View policy adherence across your organization:

1. Navigate to **Settings → Policies**
2. See summary metrics for each policy:
   - Total applicable incidents/follow-ups
   - Adherence rate
   - Current violations
   - At-risk items

### Insights and reporting

Use Insights to analyze policy adherence:

**Filter by policy state:**
- Show only incidents with policy violations
- See follow-ups at risk of violation
- Identify trends in adherence

**Split by dimensions:**
- Policy adherence by team
- Policy adherence by severity
- Policy adherence over time

**Saved views:**
- "Current policy violations"
- "Follow-ups at risk this week"
- "Policy adherence by team"

These views help leadership understand whether post-incident work is being completed consistently.

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with realistic SLAs">
    Set SLAs that are achievable given your team's capacity. Overly aggressive SLAs lead to constant violations and policy fatigue. You can tighten SLAs over time as the practice matures.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Differentiate by priority and severity">
    Not all post-incident work is equally urgent. Use expressions to set shorter SLAs for critical incidents or urgent follow-ups, and longer SLAs for less urgent work.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Send at-risk notifications early">
    Configure at-risk notifications when 50% or 75% of the SLA has elapsed. This gives teams time to act before violation.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Make violations visible">
    Share policy violations in team channels or standups. Visibility creates accountability without blame.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Review policies regularly">
    As your incident practice matures, revisit policies to ensure they still make sense. Adjust SLAs, conditions, and requirements based on actual performance and team feedback.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Focus on outcomes, not compliance">
    Policies should drive better learning and improvement, not just checkbox compliance. If teams are meeting SLAs but not producing valuable post-mortems or follow-ups, adjust your approach.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Common policy patterns

### Major incident post-mortems

**Requirement:** All major incidents must have a completed post-mortem within 5 business days.

**Configuration:**
- Scope: Incident → Severity is Major or Critical
- SLA: 5 days from resolution
- Requirements: Post-mortem is attached AND marked as complete
- Notifications: At-risk at 3 days, violated at 5 days

### Security incident follow-ups

**Requirement:** All follow-ups from security incidents must be completed within 2 days.

**Configuration:**
- Scope: Incident → Type is Security
- SLA: 2 days from incident resolution
- Requirements: Follow-up → Status is Completed or Cancelled
- Notifications: At-risk at 1 day, escalate to security team on violation

### Customer-impacting incident debriefs

**Requirement:** Customer-impacting incidents must have a debrief scheduled within 48 hours.

**Configuration:**
- Scope: Incident → Customer Impacting is Yes
- SLA: 2 days from resolution
- Requirements: Debrief is scheduled
- Notifications: Remind incident lead at 1 day

### Priority-tiered follow-ups

**Requirement:** Follow-ups must be completed based on their priority.

**Configuration:**
- Scope: All follow-ups
- SLA: Expression based on priority (3/7/14/30 days)
- Requirements: Follow-up → Status is not Outstanding
- Notifications: At-risk at 75% of SLA time

## Integration with workflows

Combine policies with workflows for powerful automation:

**Auto-assign overdue follow-ups:**
When a follow-up policy is violated, automatically reassign to the team lead.

**Escalation on repeated violations:**
When the same team violates a policy 3 times in a month, notify their manager.

**Celebration on adherence:**
When a team maintains 100% policy adherence for a month, post a celebration message in their Slack channel.

**Reminder sequences:**
Send progressively urgent reminders as follow-ups approach their SLA deadline.

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do policies apply to private incidents?">
    You can configure whether each policy applies to private incidents. By default, most policies don't apply to private incidents, but you can change this if needed.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What happens when a policy is violated?">
    Policy violations are tracked and visible in reporting, but they don't prevent any actions. They serve as a signal that post-incident work isn't being completed as expected. You can configure notifications and workflows to take action on violations.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I have multiple policies for the same thing?">
    Yes. You can have multiple policies that apply to the same incidents or follow-ups. For example, one policy might require post-mortem completion within 7 days, while another requires follow-up completion within 14 days.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do business days work in SLAs?">
    You can configure whether SLAs count calendar days or business days. Business days respect your organization's configured working hours and holidays.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can I see historical policy adherence?">
    Yes. The Insights page shows policy adherence over time, allowing you to see trends and measure improvement in your post-incident practices.
