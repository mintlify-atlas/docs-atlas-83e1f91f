title: Policies and SLAs
description: Define and enforce organizational standards for post-incident activities including debriefs, follow-ups, post-mortems, and on-call practices
---

## Overview

Policies allow you to define rules about how your organization's incident management program should operate. By setting clear expectations and automating reminders, policies ensure consistent follow-through on post-incident activities.

<Info>
Policies help answer questions like: "Are we completing follow-ups on time?" "Are post-mortems being written for major incidents?" "Are debriefs being scheduled?"
</Info>

## What you can enforce with policies

</CardGroup>

## Policy components

Every policy has several key components:

### Policy type

Choose what you want to enforce:
- **Follow-ups** - Completion requirements for follow-up actions
- **Debriefs** - Requirements for scheduling and completing debrief meetings
- **Post-mortems** - Requirements for post-mortem documents
- **On-call** - Requirements for on-call user configurations

### Scope and conditions

Define when the policy applies:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="All incidents">
    Apply the policy to every incident in your organization.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="By severity">
    ```
    Condition: Severity is one of [Critical, Major]
    ```
    Only enforce for high-severity incidents.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="By custom fields">
    ```
    Condition: Customer Impact = "High"
    AND Affected Team contains "Platform"
    ```
    Use custom fields for fine-grained control.
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="By catalog attributes">
    ```
    Condition: Affected Services → Team = "Core API"
    ```
    Leverage catalog data for dynamic scoping.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### SLA (Service Level Agreement)

Define the timeframe for completion:

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Fixed SLA" icon="clock">
    Set a single number of days for all incidents:
    
    ```
    SLA: 7 days after incident resolved
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Expression-based SLA" icon="code">
    Use expressions to set dynamic SLAs based on incident attributes:
    
    ```javascript
    if (incident.severity === "Critical") {
      return 1; // 1 day for critical
    } else if (incident.severity === "Major") {
      return 3; // 3 days for major
    } else {
      return 7; // 7 days for others
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Priority-based SLA (Follow-ups)" icon="sort">
    For follow-up policies, base SLA on follow-up priority:
    
    ```javascript
    if (followUp.priority === "Urgent") {
      return 3;
    } else if (followUp.priority === "High") {
      return 7;
    } else {
      return 14;
    }
    ```
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Requirements

Define what must be true for the policy to be fulfilled:

**Example follow-up policy requirements:**
- Follow-up → Status is not "Outstanding"
- Follow-up → Assignee is not empty

**Example post-mortem policy requirements:**
- Post-mortem → Status is "Completed"
- Post-mortem → Exported to Confluence

**Example debrief policy requirements:**
- Debrief → Is scheduled
- Debrief → Has occurred (past the scheduled time)

### Assignees and notifications

Specify who is responsible and when they should be notified:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Assignee selection">
    Choose who should be reminded:
    - **Follow-ups:** Follow-up owner
    - **Post-mortems:** Incident lead or post-mortem author
    - **Debriefs:** Debrief scheduler role
    - **On-call:** On-call user themselves
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Notification timing">
    Configure when reminders are sent:
    - **Before due date:** 2 days before, 1 day before
    - **On due date:** Day it's due
    - **After due date:** 1 day overdue, 3 days overdue, weekly thereafter
    
    <Note>
    "Before due date" notifications don't apply to on-call policies since compliance is binary - you're either in compliance or not.
    </Note>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Notification channels">
    Assignees are notified via:
    - Slack direct message
    - Email
    - Home page sidebar (right panel on dashboard)
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Creating policies

```
</CodeGroup>

## Viewing policy compliance

### In policy settings

Within each policy's configuration page:

- **Outstanding tasks** - Items currently in violation
- **Dismissed tasks** - Items that were manually dismissed
- **Compliance rate** - Percentage of items meeting the policy

### Throughout the product

Policy status appears in multiple locations:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Individual incidents" icon="file">
    See policy violations on the incident page with direct links to take action
  </Card>
  <Card title="Team pages" icon="users">
    View outstanding policy tasks for your team
  </Card>
  <Card title="Post-incident dashboard" icon="clipboard">
    Filter incidents by policy compliance status
  </Card>
  <Card title="Follow-ups page" icon="list-check">
    See which follow-ups are violating policies
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Policy reports

Schedule automated reports to stay informed:

1. Go to [Settings → Policies](https://app.incident.io/settings/policies)
2. Click **Schedule report**
3. Configure:
   - **Frequency:** Daily, weekly, or monthly
   - **Policies to include:** Select which policies to report on
   - **Destination:** Slack channel and/or email addresses
4. Save the report

Reports include:
- Summary of outstanding tasks per policy
- Compliance trends over time
- Direct links to take action

<Tip>
Schedule weekly reports to be sent to team leads or on a rolling basis to keep post-incident activities visible.
</Tip>

## Managing policy violations

### Completing tasks

From any view showing policy violations:

1. Click on the outstanding task
2. Take the required action (complete follow-up, schedule debrief, etc.)
3. The violation is automatically cleared

### Dismissing violations

If a policy violation isn't applicable:

1. Find the violation in the policy settings or incident page
2. Click **Dismiss**
3. Provide a reason for dismissal
4. The violation is removed from outstanding tasks

<Warning>
Dismissals should be used sparingly. If you find yourself dismissing many violations, consider adjusting your policy conditions.
</Warning>

## Policy best practices

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Start with templates" icon="clipboard-list">
    Use recommended templates and customize rather than starting from scratch
  </Card>
  <Card title="Set realistic SLAs" icon="calendar-check">
    Consider team capacity and incident complexity when setting timeframes
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use expressions for flexibility" icon="code">
    Dynamic SLAs based on severity or priority prevent one-size-fits-all problems
  </Card>
  <Card title="Don't over-notify" icon="bell-slash">
    Too many reminders lead to notification fatigue. Balance persistence with respect.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Review compliance regularly" icon="chart-line">
    Use policy reports to identify systemic issues, not just individual violations
  </Card>
  <Card title="Iterate based on data" icon="arrows-rotate">
    Adjust policies based on actual compliance rates and team feedback
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Common policy patterns

### Graduated enforcement

```javascript
// More lenient for lower severity
if (incident.severity === "Critical") {
  return 1; // Very urgent
} else if (incident.severity === "Major") {
  return 3; // Still important
} else if (incident.severity === "Minor") {
  return 7; // More time
} else {
  return null; // No policy for trivial incidents
}
```

### Team-specific policies

```javascript
// Different SLAs for different teams
if (incident.affectedTeam === "Core Platform") {
  return 2; // Core team has tighter SLAs
} else {
  return 5; // Other teams have more time
}
```

### Multi-requirement policies

```yaml
Requirements:
  - Post-mortem status is "Completed"
  - Post-mortem has been exported
  - Post-mortem has been shared to at least one channel
```

All requirements must be met for policy compliance.

## Policies and post-incident flow

Policies work seamlessly with the [structured post-incident process](/product-documentation/post-incident/structured-post-incident-process):

- **Post-incident flow** defines *what* tasks to complete
- **Policies** define *when* they must be completed and enforce it

Using both together provides:
- Clear workflow for responders
- Automated enforcement of SLAs
- Visibility into compliance across the organization
