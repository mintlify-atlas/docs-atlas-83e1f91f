description: Schedule and conduct effective debrief meetings to discuss post-mortems, create follow-ups, and ensure shared understanding across your team
---

## Overview

A debrief (also called a post-mortem meeting or retrospective) is a meeting held after an incident has been resolved to discuss what happened, create follow-ups, and learn from the experience. incident.io provides tools to streamline scheduling, inviting the right people, and tracking meeting outcomes.

<Info>
**Why debriefs matter:** Asynchronous post-mortem documents are valuable, but synchronous discussion ensures shared understanding, surfaces different perspectives, and builds team cohesion.
</Info>

## What is a debrief?

A debrief is typically a Google Calendar event where you:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Discuss the post-mortem" icon="comments">
    Walk through the timeline and findings together
  </Card>
  <Card title="Create follow-ups" icon="list-check">
    Identify actions to prevent recurrence
  </Card>
  <Card title="Align on learnings" icon="lightbulb">
    Ensure everyone understands what happened and why
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### When to hold debriefs

Not every incident requires a synchronous meeting. Consider holding a debrief when:

- The incident was high severity (Critical or Major)
- Multiple teams were involved
- The root cause is unclear or complex
- There are opportunities for significant improvements
- Stakeholders need to be aligned on what happened

<Tip>
You can use policies to automatically require debriefs for incidents that meet certain criteria (e.g., Critical severity, high customer impact).
</Tip>

## Scheduling debriefs

### From the post-incident flow

If your [post-incident flow](/product-documentation/post-incident/structured-post-incident-process) includes a "Schedule the debrief" task:

1. Navigate to the incident in the dashboard
2. Find the "Schedule the debrief" task
3. Click the button to create a Google Calendar event
4. The event is pre-filled with:
   - Incident ID in the title
   - Automatically invited attendees based on your configuration
   - Link to the incident and post-mortem

### Manual scheduling

From the incident homepage, click **Schedule a debrief** to create a pre-filled Google Calendar event.

### Automatic attachment

With the [Google Calendar integration](/help-centre/api-and-integrations/communication/google-calendar):

1. Create a calendar event with the incident ID (e.g., `INC-108`) in the title or description
2. incident.io detects the event and posts to the Slack channel
3. Confirm it's a debrief
4. Event details are shared with the incident channel

## Configuring debrief invitees

Automate who gets invited to debriefs based on incident attributes.

### Setting up invitees

Navigate to [Settings → Debriefs](https://app.incident.io/~/settings/debriefs) to configure:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Default invitees">
    By default, active responders are invited. You can edit or remove this.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add conditional invitees">
    Click **Add invitee** to add people or groups with optional conditions
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure conditions">
    Choose when this invitee should be included (e.g., only for Critical incidents)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select invitees">
    Choose from:
    - Active participants
    - Observers
    - Specific incident roles
    - Custom expressions returning users
    - Raw email addresses (for group emails)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Invitee options

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Incident participants">
    ### Active responders
    
    Everyone who was actively involved in responding to the incident.
    
    ### Observers
    
    People who followed the incident but weren't actively responding.
    
    ### Specific roles
    
    People who filled specific incident roles (Incident Lead, Comms Lead, etc.).
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Custom expressions">
    ### Catalog-based invitees
    
    Use the catalog to dynamically invite people:
    
    ```
    incident.affectedServices.map(s => s.teamLead)
    ```
    
    This invites the team lead of every affected service.
    
    ### Field-based invitees
    
    ```
    incident.customFields.escalationManager
    ```
    
    Invite based on custom field values.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Group emails">
    ### Distribution lists
    
    Add email addresses that aren't individual users:
    
    - `engineering-leads@company.com`
    - `product-team@company.com`
    - `executives@company.com`
    
    Click **Enter email(s) instead** to add raw email addresses.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Conditional invites">

```

## Running effective debriefs

### Before the meeting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Prepare the post-mortem" icon="file-lines">
    Ensure the [post-mortem document](/product-documentation/post-incident/post-mortem-documents) is drafted with:
    - Complete timeline
    - Initial analysis of what happened
    - Areas that need discussion marked
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Review the timeline" icon="timeline">
    Incident Lead should review the [timeline](/product-documentation/post-incident/timeline) and add any missing context or events.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Start discussions early" icon="comments">
    Use timeline comments to surface questions or ambiguities before the meeting.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Set expectations" icon="bullseye">
    Share the meeting agenda in advance:

    Document specific, assignable follow-ups with owners and due dates. Avoid vague action items.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Capture learnings">
    Document what went well and what could be improved for future incidents.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Removing or rescheduling debriefs

If you've attached a debrief to an incident but need to change it:

1. Go to the incident details page
2. Find the debrief in the sidebar
3. Click the overflow menu
4. Select **Remove debrief** or update the calendar event directly

## Debrief policies

Enforce debrief requirements using [policies](/product-documentation/post-incident/policies-and-slas):

### Example: Major incident debrief policy

<CodeGroup>
```yaml Policy configuration
Name: Major incidents require debrief
Type: Debriefs
Scope: Severity is one of [Critical, Major]
Requirement: Debrief is scheduled
SLA: 3 days after resolution
```

```yaml Notifications
Assignee: Incident Lead
Notify:
  - On due date
  - 1 day after due date
  - Every 2 days thereafter
```
</CodeGroup>

### Example: Completed debrief policy

<CodeGroup>
```yaml Policy configuration
Name: Debrief must be held
Type: Debriefs  
Scope: Debrief is scheduled
Requirement: Debrief date has passed
SLA: 7 days after scheduling
```
</CodeGroup>

<Tip>
Combine a "schedule debrief" policy with a "complete debrief" policy to ensure meetings both happen and occur in a timely manner.
</Tip>

## Debrief facilitation tips

### Creating psychological safety

- Start with a blamelessness reminder
- Thank participants for their response efforts
- Model vulnerability by discussing your own uncertainties
- Redirect blame-focused language to systems-focused language

### Asking good questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Discovery questions" icon="magnifying-glass">
    - "What were you thinking at this point?"
    - "What information did you have available?"
    - "What alternatives did you consider?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Systems questions" icon="diagram-project">
    - "Why didn't our monitoring catch this?"
    - "What made this difficult to diagnose?"
    - "What would have helped you respond faster?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Prevention questions" icon="shield-halved">
    - "How can we prevent this class of issue?"
    - "What would give us earlier warning?"
    - "What systematic changes would help?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Learning questions" icon="graduation-cap">
    - "What surprised you during this incident?"
    - "What did we handle well?"
    - "What should we do differently next time?"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Managing difficult dynamics

- **Dominating participants:** Thank them, then specifically invite quieter people to share
- **Getting stuck:** Move on and return later, or take a 5-minute break
- **Blame language:** Reframe to focus on systems: "What about our system made that choice seem reasonable?"
- **Scope creep:** Note tangential topics for follow-up, return to agenda

## Integration with post-incident flow

Debrief tasks in your [structured post-incident process](/product-documentation/post-incident/structured-post-incident-process):

<Steps>
  <Step title="Schedule the debrief">
    Task with button to create calendar event
  </Step>
  <Step title="Hold the debrief">
    Can be marked complete manually or use a policy to verify it occurred
  </Step>
  <Step title="Update post-mortem">
    Incorporate debrief insights
  </Step>
  <Step title="Complete follow-ups">
    Ensure action items from the debrief are tracked
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Asynchronous alternatives

For lower-severity incidents or distributed teams, consider:

- **Slack-based discussion:** Use timeline comments and Slack threads
- **Collaborative document editing:** Use commenting in the post-mortem document
- **Recorded video:** Record a walkthrough and share for async viewing
- **Written Q&A:** Collect questions async, answer in the document

<Info>
Asynchronous approaches work well for clear-cut incidents but are less effective when alignment on complex issues is needed.
