# Post-mortem meetings

Running an incident debrief (also called a post-mortem meeting or retrospective) is often a helpful way to ensure everyone is on the same page. These meetings help you review the post-mortem document, ensure all follow-up tasks are captured, and distill shared learnings.

incident.io helps you schedule debriefs with the right people automatically, manage calendar logistics, and integrate debrief activities into your post-incident workflow.

## Why hold debrief meetings

While written post-mortems are valuable, synchronous discussion adds important context:

**Shared understanding**
Ensure everyone involved understands what happened and why decisions were made.

**Uncover hidden issues**
Conversation often reveals insights that weren't captured in the timeline or document.

**Build psychological safety**
Reinforce a blameless culture by discussing incidents constructively as a team.

**Capture missing follow-ups**
Discussion surfaces improvements that might not have been obvious during the incident.

**Distribute knowledge**
Share learnings with team members who weren't directly involved but could benefit from the insights.

## Scheduling a debrief

Schedule debriefs directly from the incident homepage.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the incident">
    Open the incident homepage for the resolved incident.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Click 'Schedule a debrief'">
    Find the debrief section and click **Schedule a debrief**.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose scheduling method">
    Select one of:
    - **Use a placeholder slot** (Enterprise only)
    - **Schedule manually** in Google Calendar or Outlook
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review pre-filled invitees">
    incident.io automatically adds relevant people based on your configuration. Adjust the invite list if needed.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Finalize and save">
    Set the time and save the calendar event. If you have the calendar integration installed, the event is automatically attached to the incident.
  </Step>
</Steps>

The debrief is now linked to the incident, and all participants know when it's happening.

## Customizing invitee lists

The right people make debriefs effective. incident.io lets you configure sophisticated rules to automatically invite the right participants.

### Default invitees

By default, incident.io invites:
- Active responders who participated in the incident
- Users assigned to specific incident roles

You can customize this default list in debrief settings.

### Adding conditional invitees

Create rules to invite people based on incident attributes:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to debrief settings">
    Go to [Settings → Debriefs](https://app.incident.io/~/settings/debriefs).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add an invitee rule">
    Click **Add invitee** to create a new rule.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set conditions">
    Define when this invitee should be added. For example:
    - Only for major incidents
    - Only when specific services are affected
    - Only for incidents lasting more than 2 hours
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Specify who to invite">
    Choose from:
    - Specific users
    - Incident roles (Incident Lead, Communications Lead, etc.)
    - Custom expressions (e.g., service owners from the catalog)
    - Raw email addresses (for team emails)
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Inviting from the catalog

If you use the incident.io catalog, you can create powerful invitee rules:

**Example:** Invite team leads of all affected services
- Condition: Incident → Severity is Major or Critical
- Invitees: Affected Services → Team → Team Lead

This automatically invites the right people based on which services were impacted, without manual tracking.

**Example:** Invite security team for security incidents
- Condition: Incident → Type is Security
- Invitees: Security Team (from catalog)

### Raw email addresses

For team or group email addresses that aren't individual users:

1. Click **Add invitee**
2. Select **Enter email(s) instead**
3. Type the email address (e.g., `engineering-leads@company.com`)

This is useful for distribution lists or shared inboxes.

## Debrief placeholders (Enterprise)

For teams with busy calendars or distributed timezones, finding a time for debriefs can be challenging. Debrief placeholders pre-reserve time slots for potential debriefs.

### How placeholders work

1. Create recurring placeholder events in your calendar (e.g., every Wednesday at 2pm)
2. Add the tag `#incident-io-debrief-placeholder` to the event description
3. When scheduling a debrief, responders see available placeholder slots
4. Select a slot, and incident.io converts it to a real debrief event
5. If no incidents need debriefs, everyone gets the time back

### Setting up placeholders

<Steps>
  <Step title="Subscribe to the calendar">
    Ensure the calendar that will hold placeholders is subscribed in incident.io. Follow the instructions in the [calendar integration documentation](/help-centre/api-and-integrations/communication/google-calendar).
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create a placeholder event">
    Option A: Create manually in Google Calendar or Outlook:
    - Make it recurring (weekly, bi-weekly, etc.)
    - Add `#incident-io-debrief-placeholder` to the description
    - Invite relevant stakeholders
    
    Option B: Use incident.io to create it:
    - Go to [Settings → Debriefs](https://app.incident.io/settings/debriefs)
    - Click **Add placeholder**
    - Click **Create with Google Calendar**
    - Configure frequency, time, and attendees
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify the placeholder">
    The placeholder should appear in the Placeholders section of Settings → Debriefs.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Placeholders must be recurring events with `#incident-io-debrief-placeholder` in the description. incident.io only shows available slots (ones not already used for a debrief).
</Note>

### Scheduling outside placeholders

If none of the placeholder slots work, you can still schedule manually by clicking **Schedule manually** when creating the debrief.

## Running an effective debrief

A good debrief meeting follows a structure that encourages learning without blame.

### Before the meeting

**Prepare the post-mortem document**
Ensure the timeline and initial post-mortem draft are ready. Attendees should have a chance to review beforehand.

**Share context**
Send the post-mortem link and any relevant background to attendees 24 hours in advance.

**Set the tone**
Remind participants that the debrief is blameless and focused on system improvements, not individual actions.

### During the meeting

**Review the timeline (10-15 minutes)**
- Walk through what happened chronologically
- Clarify any ambiguities or gaps
- Ensure everyone understands the sequence of events

**Discuss contributing factors (15-20 minutes)**
- What conditions allowed this incident to occur?
- What systemic issues contributed?
- What worked well in the response?

**Identify improvements (15-20 minutes)**
- What can we change to prevent this incident?
- How can we improve detection and response?
- What follow-ups are needed?

**Assign ownership (5-10 minutes)**
- Ensure every follow-up has an owner
- Set target completion dates
- Clarify next steps

### After the meeting

**Update the post-mortem**
Incorporate insights from the discussion into the written post-mortem.

**Share learnings**
Post the completed post-mortem to relevant Slack channels or team spaces.

**Track follow-ups**
Ensure follow-ups are exported to your issue tracker and assigned.

<Info>
Sharing the post-mortem to Slack automatically completes the "Share the debrief document" task in your post-incident flow.

## Debrief best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Schedule within 3-5 days">
    Hold the debrief while the incident is still fresh in everyone's memory, but after immediate stress has subsided. 3-5 days after resolution is usually ideal.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Keep it focused">
    Limit debriefs to 45-60 minutes. Longer meetings lose effectiveness. If you need more time, schedule a follow-up specifically for complex technical deep-dives.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Facilitate, don't dominate">
    The incident lead or a designated facilitator should guide the discussion but encourage broad participation. Quieter team members often have valuable insights.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Focus on systems, not people">
    When discussing what went wrong, frame it in terms of system weaknesses rather than individual mistakes. Ask "Why did our system allow this?" not "Why did you do that?"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Celebrate what went right">
    Always discuss what went well. Recognition reinforces good practices and builds team confidence.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Prioritize follow-ups in the meeting">
    Don't create an overwhelming list of follow-ups. Identify the 3-5 highest-impact improvements and prioritize those.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Not every incident needs a meeting">
    Reserve synchronous debriefs for incidents with sufficient complexity or impact. Minor incidents might only need a written post-mortem with asynchronous review.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Calendar integrations

### Google Calendar

With the Google Calendar integration:
- Automatically attach debrief events to incidents
- Sync event details to the incident timeline
- Update incident status when debriefs are scheduled
- See debrief placeholders in scheduling

Configure the integration in [Settings → Integrations → Google Calendar](https://app.incident.io/settings/integrations).

### Outlook Calendar

With the Outlook Calendar integration:
- Same capabilities as Google Calendar
- Support for Microsoft 365 organizations
- Placeholder support for Enterprise customers

Configure the integration in [Settings → Integrations → Outlook](https://app.incident.io/settings/integrations).

### Service accounts

For organizations that want to manage calendar events via a service account rather than individual user accounts, incident.io supports:
- Google service account integration
- Microsoft service account integration

This ensures calendar functionality continues even when individual users leave or change roles.

## Integration with post-incident flow

Debrief scheduling integrates with your structured post-incident process:

**"Schedule the debrief" task**
Automatically completed when you schedule a debrief for the incident.

**Due dates**
Set due dates for scheduling debriefs (e.g., "within 5 days of resolution for major incidents").

**Reminders**
(Pro and Enterprise) Automatically remind the incident lead if a debrief hasn't been scheduled within the expected timeframe.

**Conditional requirements**
Require debriefs only for certain incident types (e.g., major incidents, security incidents, customer-impacting incidents).

Configure post-incident flow tasks in **Settings → Improve → Post-incident flow**.

## FAQs

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Who should facilitate the debrief?">
    Typically the Incident Lead or a designated facilitator. The facilitator should be someone who can guide discussion neutrally and ensure all voices are heard. For very complex incidents, consider using someone who wasn't deeply involved in the response.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Should executives attend debriefs?">
    It depends on your culture. Executive presence can signal the importance of learning, but may also inhibit candid discussion if psychological safety is still developing. Consider having executives review post-mortems asynchronously rather than attending all debriefs.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="What if key people can't attend?">
    If someone critical to understanding the incident can't attend, consider rescheduling. For less critical attendees, record the meeting or take detailed notes and share afterward.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="How do I handle disagreement about what happened?">
    Disagreement is valuable - it often reveals important gaps in understanding. Document multiple perspectives in the post-mortem and use the disagreement to identify areas where better observability or documentation is needed.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Should I record debrief meetings?">
    Recording can be helpful for absent team members or future reference, but may reduce candor. If you record, be explicit about who has access and ensure participants are comfortable.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
