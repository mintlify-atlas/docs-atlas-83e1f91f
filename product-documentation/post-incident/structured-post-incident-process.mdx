# Structured post-incident process

After an incident is resolved, there are usually steps you can take to learn from it and improve for the future. By doing so, you may be able to prevent the incident from happening again or improve your response to similar incidents.

The Post-Incident Flow provides a way to define a set of tasks that should be completed after an incident is resolved, but before it is closed. You can also choose which types of incidents should go through this process.

## Overview

The post-incident flow is a structured process that guides your team through learning activities after resolving an incident. Rather than relying on memory or manual processes, incident.io automates the transition from active response to post-incident learning.

<Info>
Post-incident statuses are unlike other statuses. They have tasks associated with them, and incidents automatically move through statuses as tasks are completed or marked as 'Not doing'.
</Info>

## Configuring your post-incident flow

Define the steps you'd like to take to learn from your incidents in **Settings → Improve → Post-incident flow**.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access post-incident flow settings">
    Navigate to [Settings → Improve → Post-incident flow](https://app.incident.io/~/settings/post-incident-flow). By default, you'll see a flow with two phases: `Documenting` and `Reviewing`.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure tasks for each phase">
    Add or edit tasks within each phase. Each task has a customizable description that provides instructions to your responders.
    
    **Suggested tasks include:**
    - **Review the incident timeline** - Link to jump to the incident timeline
    - **Create a post-mortem document** - Automatically completed when a post-mortem is attached
    - **Schedule the debrief** - Button to create a calendar event with all involved users
    - **Mark post-mortem as complete** - Automatically completed when the document is finalized
    - **Share the debrief document** - Automatically completed when shared to Slack
    - **Review follow-ups** - Link to open the incident's follow-ups
    - **Assign specific roles** - Require assignment of specific incident roles
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set conditions for automatic entry">
    In **Settings → Respond → Lifecycle**, configure which incidents automatically enter the post-incident flow. For example, you might require all major incidents to go through the process while making it optional for minor incidents.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
Enterprise customers can configure multiple post-incident flows for different incident types and create fully-custom tasks with their own titles and descriptions.
</Note>

## Entering the post-incident flow

When resolving an incident, responders are prompted about whether to enter the post-incident flow:

**Manual opt-in:** If not automatically required, responders choose whether to enter the flow based on the incident's learning value.

**Automatic entry:** If you've configured conditions (like "all major incidents"), qualifying incidents automatically enter the flow upon resolution.

Once an incident enters the post-incident flow:

1. The incident moves to the first post-incident status
2. A notification is sent to the incident Slack channel
3. Tasks become visible on the incident dashboard
4. Team members can be assigned specific tasks
5. The incident automatically progresses through statuses as tasks complete

## Working through tasks

From the incident dashboard, you can:

- View all tasks for the current post-incident phase
- Mark tasks as completed or skip them if not applicable
- Assign tasks to specific users (who receive notifications)
- Track progress toward phase completion

When all tasks in a post-incident status are complete, the incident automatically moves to the next status. After completing the final post-incident status, the incident closes automatically.

## Opting out of the post-incident flow

If an incident enters the post-incident flow but you decide it's not worthwhile:

- Type `/inc close` in the incident channel, or
- Select **Opt out of post-incident** in the overflow menu on the dashboard

You'll need to provide a reason, which will be included in the closure message sent to the Slack channel.

<Accordion title="How do I hide the post-incident flow entirely?">
  If you don't want to use the post-incident flow, you can [remove all post-incident statuses](https://app.incident.io/~/settings/post-incident-flow) and you won't be prompted about it when closing incidents.
</Accordion>

## Setting due dates and reminders

You can configure due dates for post-incident tasks using expressions based on incident fields and custom catalog fields. This ensures tasks are completed while the incident is still fresh in people's memories.

**To set due dates:**

1. Edit a post-incident flow task
2. Look for the due date section
3. Use expressions to calculate due dates dynamically

For example: "Post-mortem must be completed within 3 days for major incidents, 7 days for minor incidents."

<Info>
**Pro and Enterprise plans** can send automatic reminders to users about upcoming or overdue post-incident tasks.
</Info>

## Setting default assignees

On Pro and Enterprise plans, you can configure default assignees for post-incident tasks. This ensures tasks are more likely to get done and incidents progress through the flow more quickly.

When an incident enters the post-incident flow, tasks are automatically assigned based on your configuration. You can assign tasks to:

- Specific incident roles (e.g., Incident Lead)
- Custom expressions based on incident attributes
- Users from catalog entries (e.g., service owners)

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start simple and iterate">
    Begin with a basic flow of 3-4 essential tasks like creating a post-mortem and scheduling a debrief. Add complexity as your team becomes comfortable with the process.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Make tasks actionable">
    Write clear, actionable descriptions for each task. Include links to relevant documentation or templates to help responders complete tasks efficiently.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Align with severity">
    Configure different post-incident flows for different incident severities. Major incidents might require extensive documentation and debriefs, while minor incidents need lighter-weight processes.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Set realistic due dates">
    Balance the value of timely completion with the reality of your team's workload. Tasks should be completed while the incident is fresh but not create unnecessary stress.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
