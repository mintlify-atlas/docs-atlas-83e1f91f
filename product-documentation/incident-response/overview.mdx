# Overview

incident.io's incident response capabilities bring together everything your teams need to manage incidents effectively. Create incidents from alerts or manually, coordinate response across Slack or Microsoft Teams, track actions and progress, and automate routine tasks to keep incidents moving toward resolution.

## Core capabilities

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Declaring and responding to incidents" icon="rocket" href="/product-documentation/incident-response/responding-to-incidents">
    Create incidents in seconds from Slack, Microsoft Teams, or the dashboard. Configure custom forms to capture the right context upfront, assign roles to clarify who's doing what, and start coordinating response immediately.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Managing incident lifecycle" icon="arrows-rotate" href="/product-documentation/incident-response/incident-lifecycle">
    Track incidents through clear stages from Triage to Active to Post-incident. Use timestamps to measure response time, pause incidents when needed, merge duplicates, and understand where each incident stands at a glance.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Coordinating in channels" icon="comments" href="/product-documentation/incident-response/channel-management">
    Work where your team already collaborates. Incident channels automatically create in Slack or Teams, bringing together participants, actions, and updates. Customize announcements, bookmarks, and create streams for complex incidents that need focused sub-groups.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Tracking actions and updates" icon="list-check" href="/product-documentation/incident-response/incident-actions">
    Create actions with emoji reactions or commands, track who's responsible for what, and share status updates with your team and customers. Keep everyone informed without leaving your incident channel.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Automating incident workflows" icon="workflow" href="/product-documentation/incident-response/automated-workflows">
    Build workflows that trigger during incidents to assign roles, create actions, send updates, and handle routine tasks automatically. Focus on response while incident.io handles the process.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Collaborating in real-time" icon="video" href="/product-documentation/incident-response/video-calls">
    Launch video calls directly from incident channels for digital war rooms. Connect Zoom, Google Meet, or Microsoft Teams to bring responders together when incidents need synchronous collaboration.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Escalating when needed" icon="arrow-up" href="/product-documentation/incident-response/incident-escalations">
    Page additional responders or raise severity when incidents require more help. Choose between hard escalations that notify people immediately or soft escalations that adjust incident priority.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Staying on track with nudges" icon="bell" href="/product-documentation/incident-response/nudges">
    Smart automated reminders keep incidents moving forward. Eight default nudges prompt responders to assign leads, send updates, resolve inactive incidents, and complete other critical actions at the right time.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Closing incidents" icon="check-circle" href="/product-documentation/incident-response/housekeeping-and-tidy-up">
    Resolve incidents properly to preserve incident history, archive channels, and transition smoothly to post-incident workflows.
  </Card>
