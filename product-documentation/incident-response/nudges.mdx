# Nudges

Nudges send automated reminders to incident channels, prompting responders to take important actions like providing updates, assigning roles, or resolving inactive incidents. They help maintain momentum during incidents by ensuring critical tasks don't get forgotten when teams are focused on resolution.

incident.io includes 8 default nudges that cover common incident response actions. These nudges use smart scheduling to adapt their timing based on incident activity, minimizing noise while keeping teams on track.

## Default nudges

incident.io comes with 8 pre-configured nudges that prompt responders to complete essential incident tasks:

These nudges run automatically during incidents without requiring configuration.

## Smart scheduling

Nudges use smart scheduling to minimize noise in incident channels. Rather than running on fixed intervals, incident.io adapts when nudges appear based on channel activity.

For example, if another nudge was just sent, the system delays the next nudge by a few minutes to avoid overwhelming the channel. This context-aware timing helps nudges feel helpful rather than intrusive, especially during high-activity incidents when responders are actively coordinating.

<Info>
Smart scheduling is enabled by default and runs automatically across all nudges.

## Customizing nudges

On Pro or Enterprise plans, you can edit existing nudges, create new ones, or disable default nudges entirely.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to Settings">
    Go to **Settings → Nudges**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select or create a nudge">
    Select the nudge you want to edit or click **Add nudge** to create a new one
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure nudge settings">
    - **Message**: Customize the text sent to incident channels
    - **Frequency**: Adjust how often the nudge repeats
    - **Conditions**: Define when the nudge should trigger based on incident attributes or state
  </Step>
</Steps>

Custom nudges let you tailor reminders to your team's specific workflows and incident response practices.

<Tip>
You can use incident attributes and custom fields in nudge messages to make them more contextual. For example, reference the Incident Lead using `Incident->Incident Lead` to @mention them in Slack.
