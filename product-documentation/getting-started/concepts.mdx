# Core Concepts

Understanding these fundamental concepts will help you get the most out of incident.io. This guide explains the key building blocks and how they connect to create a comprehensive incident management system.

## Basic concepts

These are the core entities you'll interact with daily in incident.io.

### Alert

An alert is an automated signal from your monitoring systems that something unusual or problematic has been detected. Alerts contain information about what's broken - the raw data that helps your team understand and respond to issues.

<Info>
Think of alerts as notifications that "something might be wrong." They're automated signals, not incidents yet.
</Info>

When an alert fires, it doesn't automatically mean you need a full incident response. Instead, alerts give you options based on your configuration:

- **Send to a Slack channel** for awareness without paging anyone
- **Page someone** to investigate through escalations
- **Automatically create an incident** if the issue is serious enough

Alerts include key information:

- **Title and description**: What's wrong in human-readable form
- **Metadata**: Technical details like error rates, thresholds, affected hosts
- **Priority**: Urgent vs. in-hours (determines response speed)
- **Source**: Which monitoring system sent the alert

**Example alert flow:**
```text
Datadog alert fires → Alert route evaluates → Decision:
  - Minor issue → Post to #alerts channel
  - Major issue → Create escalation + page on-call
  - Critical issue → Create incident + page multiple teams
```text

### Escalation

An escalation is how you get hold of one or more people when you need human attention - think of it as "paging someone." It's the mechanism that notifies the right person at the right time through their preferred channels.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Notification channels" icon="bell">
    - Push notifications (mobile app)
    - SMS text messages
    - Phone calls (voice)
    - Slack/Teams direct messages
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Escalation statuses" icon="list">
    - **Triggered**: Notification sent
    - **Acknowledged**: Someone's on it
    - **Cancelled**: No longer needed
    - **Expired**: No response in time
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Escalations can be triggered in several ways:

- **From alerts**: Automatically when alert routes decide to page someone
- **Manually**: Using `/incident escalate` during an active incident
- **From workflows**: Automated based on incident conditions

**Why escalations matter:** They ensure the right people are notified immediately when critical issues occur, and they track whether someone has acknowledged responsibility.

### Incident

An incident is a coordinated workspace where humans and machines respond together when things break. It's where your team collaborates to understand, fix, and communicate about problems affecting your systems or services.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial triage">
    **What's happening?** Understand the scope, severity, and impact of the issue.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Active response">
    **Fix it.** Investigate root causes, implement fixes, coordinate across teams.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Resolution">
    **Verify the fix.** Confirm systems are healthy and impact is resolved.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Closure & learning">
    **Learn from it.** Complete post-mortems, action items, and prevent recurrence.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Each incident automatically creates:

- **Dedicated channel**: Slack or Teams channel for collaboration
- **Timeline**: Chronological log of all events and actions
- **Status tracking**: Current state, severity, assigned roles
- **Action items**: Follow-up tasks that need completion

To learn more about managing incidents end-to-end, see [Incident response](/product-documentation/incident-response/overview).

## Configuration concepts

These concepts help you customize how incident.io routes alerts, notifies people, and enforces standards.

### Alert route

An alert route determines what happens when an alert comes in. Think of it as a decision tree: if this type of alert fires, then take these actions.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Route to channel">
    **Use case:** Awareness without waking anyone up
    
    ```
    IF alert.severity = "low"
    THEN post to #alerts-feed
    ```
    
    Great for:
    - Low-priority warnings
    - Informational alerts
    - Non-urgent monitoring signals
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Create escalation">
    **Use case:** Page the on-call engineer
    
    ```
    IF alert.severity = "high"
    THEN escalate via "Backend On-call" path
    ```
    
    Great for:
    - Issues needing immediate investigation
    - Production alerts affecting users
    - Service degradation
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Create incident">
    **Use case:** Automatically start coordinated response
    
    ```
    IF alert.severity = "critical"
    THEN create incident + escalate
    ```
    
    Great for:
    - Major outages
    - Security incidents
    - Data integrity issues
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

**Grouping rules:** You can also configure alert routes to group related alerts into the same incident, preventing alert fatigue and keeping related issues together.

Example:
```text
Group alerts by: service + environment
Window: 30 minutes

Result: All alerts for "api-gateway" in "production" within 30 minutes → Same incident
```text

### Schedule

A schedule defines who's available to respond at specific times. It manages your on-call rotations, ensuring someone is always ready to handle issues that need immediate attention.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Rotation patterns" icon="rotate">
    - **Daily**: Handoff every day
    - **Weekly**: Handoff every week
    - **Custom**: Every N days/weeks
    - **Follow-the-sun**: Different people for different timezones
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Coverage options" icon="clock">
    - **24/7**: Round-the-clock coverage
    - **Business hours**: Weekdays 9-5 only
    - **Weekdays vs. weekends**: Different people for different days
    - **Layered**: Multiple people on-call simultaneously
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Advanced scheduling features:**

- **Calendar integration**: Sync with Google Calendar or Outlook to automatically handle time off
- **Holiday support**: Configure public holidays when coverage needs change
- **Overrides**: Temporarily swap shifts without disrupting the regular rotation
- **Coverage requests**: Let team members request coverage from colleagues

**Example schedule structure:**
```text
Schedule: Platform On-call
├─ Layer 1 (Primary): Weekly rotation, 24/7
│  └─ Alice → Bob → Carol → David → repeat
├─ Layer 2 (Backup): Weekly rotation, 24/7
│  └─ Eve → Frank → repeat
└─ Layer 3 (Manager): Business hours only
   └─ Grace
```text

### Escalation path

An escalation path defines the route an escalation takes to reach people. It answers: who should we try first? If they don't respond, who's next? Should we notify multiple people at once or one at a time?

<Steps>
  <Step title="Level 1: Primary on-call">
    Try the person currently on-call for the service team.
    
    **Wait time:** 5 minutes for acknowledgment
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Level 2: Backup on-call">
    If no response, escalate to the backup engineer.
    
    **Wait time:** 5 minutes for acknowledgment
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Level 3: Manager">
    If still no response, notify the engineering manager.
    
    **Wait time:** No timeout (final level)
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Path types:**

- **Serial escalation**: Try person A, then B, then C (one at a time)
- **Parallel escalation**: Notify A and B simultaneously
- **Round-robin**: Distribute escalations evenly across a team

**Conditional routing:** Paths can branch based on conditions:

```text
IF escalation.priority = "urgent"
  → Page primary on-call immediately
  → Skip to manager after 2 minutes

IF escalation.priority = "in-hours"
  → Only page during business hours
  → Send Slack DM if outside hours
```text

<Info>
This flexibility means you're not waking people up at 3 AM for issues that can wait until morning.
</Info>

### Call route

A call route gives you a dedicated phone number that automatically connects callers to whoever's currently on-call. It's designed for situations where someone needs to reach your team by phone.

**Use cases:**

- **Customer emergencies**: Give customers an emergency contact number
- **Vendor alerts**: Third-party services can alert you by phone
- **Non-technical escalations**: Business stakeholders can reach engineering

**How it works:**

1. Someone calls your incident.io phone number
2. incident.io looks up who's currently on-call (based on your schedules)
3. The call is routed through your escalation path logic
4. If the first person doesn't answer, it tries the next person
5. The call is recorded and logged in incident.io

<Note>
The routing happens automatically based on your current schedules - you share a stable number externally without updating it when rotations change.
</Note>

### Policies

Policies help you enforce incident response standards across your organization. They're automated rules that check whether your team is following best practices - and flag it when they're not.

**Common policy examples:**

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Post-mortem timeliness">
    **Rule:** All critical incidents must have a post-mortem completed within 7 days of resolution.
    
    **Why it matters:** Ensures you capture learnings while details are fresh.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Action item completion">
    **Rule:** All action items must be completed within 30 days of incident closure.
    
    **Why it matters:** Prevents technical debt and ensures fixes are actually implemented.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Incident lead assignment">
    **Rule:** All major incidents must have an Incident Lead assigned within 15 minutes.
    
    **Why it matters:** Ensures clear ownership and coordination during response.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Status page updates">
    **Rule:** Customer-facing incidents must have status page updates every 30 minutes.
    
    **Why it matters:** Maintains customer trust through transparent communication.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

**Policy violations:**

When policies aren't met, incident.io:
- Flags the violation in the dashboard
- Can send notifications to managers or leads
- Tracks compliance metrics over time
- Helps you identify systemic issues

<Info>
Policies are particularly useful for compliance requirements or maintaining consistent incident response quality as your team grows.
</Info>

## Catalog

The Catalog is your connected map of everything that exists in your organization. It's how incident.io understands your unique organizational context - your services, teams, products, customers, and how they all relate to each other.

### How the Catalog works

Think of the Catalog as a set of interconnected spreadsheets, or a set of database tables:

- Each "spreadsheet" is a **Catalog Type** (like Services, Teams, or Products)
- Each row in that spreadsheet is an **Entry** (like your "payments-api" service or your "platform" team)
- The columns are **Attributes** that describe each entry and create connections between different types

**Example Catalog structure:**

```text
Catalog Type: Services
├─ Entry: payments-api
│  ├─ On-call team → Platform Team
│  ├─ Repository → github.com/acme/payments
│  ├─ Status page component → Payment Processing
│  └─ Priority → High
├─ Entry: user-dashboard
│  ├─ On-call team → Frontend Team
│  └─ Priority → Medium
└─ ...

Catalog Type: Teams
├─ Entry: Platform Team
│  ├─ Slack channel → #platform
│  ├─ Schedule → Platform On-call
│  └─ Manager → Alice
└─ ...
```text

### Why the Catalog matters

The Catalog powers routing and automation throughout incident.io:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Smart alert routing" icon="route">
    "When an alert for the payments-api service fires, automatically page whoever's on-call for the Platform Team."
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Automatic tagging" icon="tag">
    "Tag incidents with the affected service's priority level and owner."
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Context in incidents" icon="circle-info">
    "Show runbooks, dashboards, and recent incidents for affected services."
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Dependency tracking" icon="diagram-project">
    "When the database service has an incident, alert all dependent services' teams."
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Scaling with your organization:**

As you grow, the Catalog scales with you - you're not editing individual alert routes every time a team changes. Update the Catalog once, and all routing/automation adapts automatically.

### Catalog flexibility

The Catalog is deliberately un-opinionated. Unlike other tools that force you into their taxonomy, incident.io lets you use your own structure and naming conventions.

**Built-in types:**
- Services
- Teams
- Users

**Custom types you can add:**
- Products
- Customers
- Environments (staging, production, etc.)
- Regions (US-East, EU-West, etc.)
- Business units
- Literally anything else

**Importing existing catalogs:**

If you already have a service catalog in a developer portal, import it directly:

- [Backstage](/product-documentation/integrations/backstage)
- [Cortex](/product-documentation/integrations/cortex)
- [OpsLevel](/product-documentation/integrations/opslevel)
- [ServiceNow](/product-documentation/integrations/servicenow)

<Info>
The Catalog is the foundation that makes incident.io context-aware. Invest time in setting it up well, and everything else becomes easier.
</Info>

## Workflow

A workflow automates actions during incidents based on triggers you define. Think of it as "if this happens, then do that" - when conditions are met, workflows execute tasks without manual intervention.

### Workflow anatomy

<Steps>
  <Step title="Trigger">
    **What sets it off?**
    
    - Incident created
    - Incident updated (severity changed, status changed, etc.)
    - Someone joins incident channel
    - Message posted in incident channel
    - Alert received
    - Scheduled time
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Conditions">
    **When should it run?**
    
    - If severity is "critical"
    - If affected service is "payments-api"
    - If incident has been active for > 1 hour
    - If it's outside business hours
    
    Multiple conditions can be combined with AND/OR logic.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Actions">
    **What does it do?**
    
    - Assign roles automatically
    - Create action items
    - Post status updates
    - Send Slack notifications
    - Update external systems (Jira, PagerDuty, etc.)
    - Page additional responders
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example workflows

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Auto-assign roles by service">
    **Trigger:** Incident created
    
    **Conditions:** Affected service is "payments-api"
    
    **Actions:**
    - Assign Incident Lead → Person on-call for Platform Team
    - Assign Comms Lead → Person on-call for Support Team
    - Post message: "Payment service incident - database team notified"
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Escalate stale incidents">
    **Trigger:** Incident updated (every 30 minutes)
    
    **Conditions:**
    - Severity is "major" or "critical"
    - Status is "active"
    - No status update in last 30 minutes
    
    **Actions:**
    - Post reminder: "@incident-lead Please post a status update"
    - If no update after 1 hour → Escalate to engineering manager
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Create post-mortem on resolution">
    **Trigger:** Incident resolved
    
    **Conditions:** Severity is "major" or "critical"
    
    **Actions:**
    - Create Google Doc from template
    - Populate with incident timeline
    - Create action item: "Complete post-mortem within 7 days"
    - Post link in incident channel
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Update status page automatically">
    **Trigger:** Incident severity changed to "critical"
    
    **Conditions:** Affected service has linked status page component
    
    **Actions:**
    - Update status page component to "Major Outage"
    - Post update: "We are investigating an issue affecting [service]"
    - Send notification to subscribers
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Info>
Workflows are powerful because they codify your team's processes and ensure consistency even under pressure. Start with a few simple workflows and expand as you identify patterns.
</Info>

## How concepts connect

Here's how everything fits together in a real-world scenario:

```text
1. Alert fires from Datadog
   ↓
2. Alert route evaluates conditions
   ↓ (severity = critical, service = payments-api)
3. Create escalation via "Platform On-call" path
   ↓
4. Schedule determines Alice is on-call
   ↓
5. Alice gets paged via push + SMS + call
   ↓
6. Alert route also creates incident automatically
   ↓
7. Incident channel created: #inc-456-payment-failures
   ↓
8. Workflow triggers (incident created + service = payments-api)
   ↓
9. Workflow actions execute:
   - Assign Alice as Incident Lead
   - Assign Bob as Comms Lead
   - Create action: "Check database health"
   - Post to #incidents channel
   - Update status page
   ↓
10. Alice acknowledges escalation, incident response begins
    ↓
11. Team investigates using incident channel
    ↓
12. Status updates posted per policy (every 30 min)
    ↓
13. Issue resolved, incident marked resolved
    ↓
14. Workflow triggers (incident resolved)
    ↓
15. Post-mortem document created automatically
    ↓
16. Follow-up actions tracked through to completion
    ↓
17. Policy validates: post-mortem completed within 7 days ✓
