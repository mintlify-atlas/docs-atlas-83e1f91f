# Core Concepts

Understand the key concepts that power incident.io. These building blocks work together to help you respond to incidents, manage on-call rotations, and automate your incident response process.

## Basic Concepts

These are the core entities you'll work with daily:

<CardGroup cols={3}>
  <Card title="Alerts" icon="bell" iconType="duotone">
    Automated signals from monitoring systems
  </Card>
  <Card title="Escalations" icon="arrow-up-right-from-square" iconType="duotone">
    Notifications to reach people who need to respond
  </Card>
  <Card title="Incidents" icon="fire" iconType="duotone">
    Coordinated workspaces for response
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### Alert

An **alert** is an automated signal from your monitoring systems that something unusual or problematic has been detected. Alerts contain information about what's broken - the raw data that helps your team understand and respond to issues.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="What Alerts Contain">
    Alerts include key information:

    - **Title**: Brief description of the problem
    - **Description**: Detailed context about what's happening
    - **Priority**: Urgent (requires immediate response) vs. In-hours (can wait)
    - **Metadata**: Tags, service identifiers, severity levels from your monitoring tool
    - **Timestamp**: When the alert was triggered

    <Note>
      Alerts are the "what" - incidents are the "how we respond."
    </Note>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="What Happens to Alerts">
    When an alert fires, it doesn't automatically create an incident. Instead, alerts give you options based on your configuration:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Route to awareness">
        Send the alert to a Slack channel for team visibility without paging anyone.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Create escalation">
        Page someone to investigate the issue.
      </Step>
      <Step title="Auto-create incident">
        Automatically create an incident if the issue is serious enough.
      </Step>
    </Steps>

    You configure these actions using **Alert Routes**.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Alert Grouping">
    incident.io can group related alerts together to prevent alert fatigue:

    - Multiple alerts about the same service go into one incident
    - Alerts with similar metadata are bundled
    - Duplicates are suppressed automatically

    This keeps your team focused on the problem, not managing dozens of individual alerts.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Escalation

An **escalation** is how you get hold of one or more people when you need human attention - think of it as "paging someone." It's the mechanism that notifies the right person at the right time through their preferred channels.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How Escalations Work" icon="circle-info">
    When you create an escalation:

    1. **Trigger**: Something initiates the escalation (alert, workflow, manual action)
    2. **Path Selection**: incident.io follows your configured escalation path
    3. **Notification**: The first person/group receives notifications via:
       - Push notifications (mobile app)
       - SMS text messages
       - Phone calls
    4. **Escalation Levels**: If no response, move to the next person/group
    5. **Acknowledgment**: Someone acknowledges they're responding

    <Tip>
      Configure retry attempts and timing between levels to balance urgency with avoiding unnecessary pages.
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Escalation Status" icon="list-check">
    Each escalation has a status:

    | Status | Description |
    |--------|-------------|
    | <Badge color="yellow">Triggered</Badge> | Notifications sent, waiting for response |
    | <Badge color="green">Acknowledged</Badge> | Someone confirmed they're handling it |
    | <Badge color="gray">Cancelled</Badge> | No longer needed, manually cancelled |
    | <Badge color="red">Expired</Badge> | No response received within timeout period |

    Track escalation effectiveness in **Insights → Escalations**.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Escalation Sources" icon="diagram-project">
    Escalations can be triggered from:

    - **Alerts**: Automatically when alert routes specify escalation
    - **Manual**: Using `/inc escalate` command during an incident
    - **Workflows**: As an automated step in your incident workflows
    - **Call Routes**: When someone calls your incident.io phone number

    All escalation sources follow the same escalation paths you configure.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Incident

An **incident** is a coordinated workspace where humans and machines respond together when things break. It's where your team collaborates to understand, fix, and communicate about problems affecting your systems or services.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Incident Lifecycle">
    Incidents move through a clear lifecycle:

    <Steps>
      <Step title="Triage">
        **Investigating**: Is this a real incident?
        
        - Review initial reports or alerts
        - Determine if full incident response is needed
        - Accept (move to Active) or Decline (close without full response)
      </Step>

      <Step title="Active">
        **Responding**: Coordinate to resolve the issue
        
        - Assign roles (Incident Lead, Communications Lead, etc.)
        - Investigate and implement fixes
        - Share status updates with stakeholders
        - Track actions and decisions on timeline
      </Step>

      <Step title="Resolved">
        **Complete**: Issue is fixed
        
        - Mark incident as resolved
        - Final status update sent
        - Post-incident workflows trigger
        - Channel archived (optional)
      </Step>

      <Step title="Closed">
        **Learning**: Post-incident activities complete
        
        - Follow-up actions completed
        - Post-mortem written
        - Incident fully closed
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="What Incidents Include">
    Each incident creates:

        What happened, why, and how to improve
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Creating Incidents">
    Incidents can be created:

    **Manually:**
    - `/incident` command in Slack
    - incident.io tab in Microsoft Teams
    - [app.incident.io/declare](https://app.incident.io/declare)

    **Automatically:**
    - Alert routes auto-create for critical alerts
    - Workflows trigger incident creation
    - API integrations from external systems

## Configuration Concepts

These concepts define how incident.io routes alerts and pages people:

### Alert Route

An **alert route** determines what happens when an alert comes in. Think of it as a decision tree: if this type of alert fires, then take these actions.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Route Actions">
    Alert routes can trigger multiple actions:

    <CardGroup cols={3}>
      <Card title="Send to Channel" icon="hashtag">
        Post in Slack/Teams for awareness
        
        No pages, just visibility
      </Card>

      <Card title="Create Escalation" icon="bell-on">
        Page the on-call engineer
        
        Triggers notifications
      </Card>

      <Card title="Create Incident" icon="fire">
        Automatically start response
        
        Critical issues need coordination
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>

    Routes can combine actions - for example, send to channel AND create escalation.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Route Conditions">
    Routes use conditions to match specific alerts:

    ```yaml
    # Route by severity
    alert.severity = "critical" → Create incident

    # Route by service tag
    alert.metadata["service"] = "payments" → Page payments team

    # Route by priority
    alert.priority = "urgent" AND 
    alert.tags contains "production" → Escalate immediately

    # Route by time
    During business hours → Send to channel
    After hours → Create escalation
    ```

    <Tip>
      Start with simple routes and add complexity as you understand your alert patterns.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Grouping Rules">
    Set up grouping to prevent alert fatigue:

    **Group by service:**
    ```yaml
    alerts with same service tag → one incident
    ```

    **Group by time window:**
    ```yaml
    alerts within 5 minutes → merge into existing incident
    ```

    **Group by similarity:**
    ```yaml
    alerts with matching title pattern → bundle together
    ```

    This keeps related alerts organized without overwhelming your team.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Schedule

A **schedule** defines who's available to respond at specific times. It manages your on-call rotations, ensuring someone is always ready to handle issues that need immediate attention.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Schedule Components" icon="calendar">
    Schedules consist of:

    - **Layers**: Different coverage patterns (weekday, weekend, night shift)
    - **Rotations**: How frequently people swap (daily, weekly, monthly)
    - **Participants**: Team members in the rotation
    - **Handoff times**: When shifts change (e.g., 9 AM local time)
    - **Timezone**: The schedule's reference timezone

    <Note>
      Layers stack on top of each other. Use them for complex coverage like "weekday primary + after-hours secondary."
    </Note>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Advanced Features" icon="gears">
    Schedules handle complexity:

    **Time off integration:**
    - Sync with Google Calendar or Outlook
    - Automatically skip people on vacation
    - Backfill with next person in rotation

    **Holiday calendars:**
    - Configure public holidays by country
    - Adjust coverage for holiday periods
    - Different rotation for holidays vs. regular days

    **Override shifts:**
    - Manually override who's on-call
    - Create one-time coverage changes
    - Swap shifts between team members
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Multiple Participants" icon="users">
    Layer multiple people in the same time slot:

    - **Primary + Secondary**: Primary gets paged first, secondary escalates after timeout
    - **Team coverage**: Page multiple people simultaneously
    - **Follow-the-sun**: Different people for different timezones

    This ensures someone always responds while providing backup coverage.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Escalation Path

An **escalation path** defines the route an escalation takes to reach people. It answers: who should we try first? If they don't respond, who's next? Should we notify multiple people at once or one at a time?

<Steps>
  <Step title="Level 1: Primary Response">
    First attempt to reach someone:

    - **Target**: Reference a schedule (e.g., "Backend Primary")
    - **Wait time**: How long to wait for acknowledgment (typically 5 minutes)
    - **Notification methods**: Push, SMS, phone call

    <Tip>
      Start with push notifications only for less urgent issues to avoid unnecessary wake-ups.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Level 2: Secondary Response">
    If Level 1 doesn't respond:

    - **Target**: Different schedule or specific person
    - **Wait time**: Typically shorter (3 minutes)
    - **Notification methods**: Add phone calls for urgency

    This might page a manager or a different team member.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Level 3: Final Escalation">
    Last resort:

    - **Target**: Senior leadership or entire team
    - **Notification methods**: All channels (push, SMS, phone)
    - **Broadcast**: Notify multiple people simultaneously

    Use this level to ensure critical issues never go unnoticed.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  **Balance urgency with fatigue**: Don't escalate too aggressively for non-urgent issues. Configure different paths for urgent vs. in-hours alerts.
</Warning>

**Conditional escalation:**

Paths can branch based on conditions:

```yaml
IF alert.priority = "urgent"
  → Level 1: Immediate page with phone call
  → Level 2: Page manager after 2 minutes

IF alert.priority = "in-hours"  
  → Level 1: Push notification only
  → Level 2: Page after 10 minutes during business hours
```

### Call Route

A **call route** gives you a dedicated phone number that automatically connects callers to whoever's currently on-call. It's designed for situations where someone needs to reach your team by phone - maybe a customer has your emergency number, or a vendor needs to alert you about a critical issue.

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="How Call Routes Work">
    <Steps>
      <Step title="Someone calls your number">
        External party dials your incident.io phone number.
      </Step>

      <Step title="incident.io routes the call">
        Follows your configured escalation path to find who's currently on-call.
      </Step>

      <Step title="First responder receives call">
        Current on-call person's phone rings.
      </Step>

      <Step title="No answer? Escalate">
        If they don't answer, move to next person in escalation path.
      </Step>

      <Step title="Call connects">
        When someone answers, caller is connected to responder.
      </Step>
    </Steps>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Configuration">
    Set up call routes:

    1. **Request a phone number** from incident.io (or port your existing number)
    2. **Choose escalation path** that determines routing
    3. **Set greeting message** (optional audio played to callers)
    4. **Configure business hours** (route differently outside hours)

    <Note>
      Share this single, stable phone number externally without worrying about updating it when rotations change.
    </Note>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Use Cases">
    Common call route scenarios:

    - **Customer emergency hotline**: VIP customers call when they have critical issues
    - **Vendor alerts**: Third-party providers notify you of problems
    - **Physical security**: Building security calls for IT escalations
    - **Legacy integrations**: Systems that can only trigger alerts via phone

    All calls are logged and tracked in incident.io.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Policies

**Policies** help you enforce incident response standards across your organization. They're automated rules that check whether your team is following best practices - and flag it when they're not.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Deadline Policies" icon="clock">
    Enforce time-based requirements
    
    - Post-mortems written within 48 hours
    - Follow-up actions completed within 7 days
    - Status updates shared every 30 minutes
  </Card>

  <Card title="Required Field Policies" icon="clipboard-check">
    Ensure data quality
    
    - All critical incidents have affected services
    - Incidents require assigned roles before resolution
    - Resolution notes are mandatory
  </Card>

  <Card title="Process Policies" icon="list-check">
    Validate workflows
    
    - Video calls required for major incidents
    - Status page updates for customer-facing issues
    - Stakeholder notifications sent
  </Card>

  <Card title="Compliance Policies" icon="shield-check">
    Meet regulatory requirements
    
    - Security incidents notify security team
    - Data breach incidents follow specific process
    - Audit trails maintained
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

**Policy violations:**

When a policy is violated:
- incident.io surfaces the violation in dashboards
- Notifications sent to relevant stakeholders
- Metrics tracked for compliance reporting

<Info>
  Policies are particularly useful for maintaining consistent incident response quality as your team grows.
</Info>

---

## Catalog

The **Catalog** is your connected map of everything that exists in your organization. It's how incident.io understands your unique organizational context - your services, teams, products, customers, and how they all relate to each other.

### Structure

Think of the Catalog as a set of interconnected spreadsheets, or database tables:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Catalog Types">
    Each "spreadsheet" is a **Catalog Type**:

    - **Services**: Your applications and systems
    - **Teams**: Your organizational teams
    - **Products**: Business products or features
    - **Customers**: Your customer base
    - **Environments**: Production, staging, development

    You can create custom types for anything relevant to your organization.

    <Tip>
      Start with Services and Teams - these power most routing and automation.
    </Tip>
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Entries">
    Each row in that "spreadsheet" is an **Entry**:

    - **services/payments-api**: Your payments service
    - **teams/platform**: Your platform engineering team
    - **products/checkout**: Your checkout product

    Entries are the individual things you want to track.
  </Tab>

  <Tab title="Attributes">
    The columns are **Attributes** that describe entries:

    - **Name**: Human-readable name
    - **Description**: What it does
    - **Owner**: Reference to a team (connection)
    - **On-call Schedule**: Which schedule covers this service
    - **Repository**: Link to code
    - **Status**: Active, deprecated, etc.

    Attributes can reference other catalog entries, creating relationships.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Why the Catalog Matters

The Catalog powers routing and automation:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Smart routing">
    **Example**: Alert tagged with `service:payments`
    
    incident.io looks up the payments service in the Catalog, finds the associated on-call schedule, and pages the right team automatically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Context enrichment">
    **Example**: Incident affecting payments service
    
    incident.io automatically:
    - Invites the service owner
    - Links to runbooks and documentation
    - Shows recent deployments
    - Displays dependent services
  </Step>

  <Step title="Relationship mapping">
    **Example**: Customer X reports an issue
    
    Catalog shows which services Customer X uses, which teams own those services, and escalation paths for each.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  As your organization grows, the Catalog scales with you. You're not editing individual alert routes every time a team changes - the Catalog maintains those relationships.
</Note>

### Catalog is Un-opinionated

Unlike other tools that force you into their taxonomy, incident.io lets you use your own structure:

- **Your naming conventions**: Call things what your team calls them
- **Your hierarchy**: Organize however makes sense for you  
- **Your attributes**: Track what matters to your organization

**Import from existing catalogs:**
- Backstage
- Cortex
- OpsLevel  
- ServiceNow CMDB
- Custom systems via API

---

## Workflows

A **workflow** automates actions during incidents based on triggers you define. Think of it as "if this happens, then do that" - when an incident is created or changed, when someone joins a channel, or when a message is posted, workflows can automatically execute tasks without manual intervention.

### Workflow Structure

<Steps>
  <Step title="Trigger">
    **What sets it off:**
    
    - Incident created
    - Incident updated (severity changed, status changed)
    - Person joined incident channel
    - Message posted with specific content
    - Escalation created or acknowledged
    - Time-based (30 minutes after incident starts)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Conditions">
    **When it should run:**
    
    ```yaml
    IF incident.severity = "Critical"
    AND incident.affected_service = "payments"
    AND time.is_business_hours = false
    ```

    Conditions filter which incidents trigger the workflow.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Steps">
    **What it does:**
    
    - Assign roles
    - Create escalations
    - Send notifications
    - Post messages to channels
    - Create follow-up actions
    - Update status pages
    - Call external APIs
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example Workflows

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Auto-assign roles based on service" icon="user-tag">
    **Trigger**: Incident created
    
    **Conditions**: `incident.affected_service` is set
    
    **Steps**:
    1. Look up service owner from Catalog
    2. Assign service owner as Subject Matter Expert
    3. Post message: "@owner has been assigned as SME"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Page on-call for critical incidents" icon="bell">
    **Trigger**: Incident severity changed to Critical
    
    **Conditions**: No conditions (always run)
    
    **Steps**:
    1. Create escalation for "Engineering Leadership" path
    2. Post message: "Leadership has been paged due to critical severity"
    3. Send notification to #executive-alerts channel
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Reminder to update status page" icon="clock">
    **Trigger**: 30 minutes after incident created
    
    **Conditions**: 
    - `incident.severity` = Major or Critical
    - No status page update posted
    
    **Steps**:
    1. Post message: "Reminder: Update the status page with customer impact"
    2. Create follow-up action: "Post status page update"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Create post-mortem document" icon="file-alt">
    **Trigger**: Incident resolved
    
    **Conditions**: `incident.severity` = Major or Critical
    
    **Steps**:
    1. Create Google Doc from post-mortem template
    2. Populate doc with incident details and timeline
    3. Post link in incident channel
    4. Create follow-up action: "Complete post-mortem within 48 hours"
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

<Tip>
  Start with simple workflows and gradually add complexity as you see what works for your team.
</Tip>

---

## Putting It All Together

Here's how these concepts work together in a typical incident flow:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Alert fires from Datadog">
    Your monitoring tool detects an issue and sends an alert to incident.io.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Alert route evaluates conditions">
    The alert route checks: "Is this alert tagged with service:payments and severity:critical?"
    
    **Yes** → Create escalation AND auto-create incident
  </Step>

  <Step title="Escalation follows path">
    Escalation path "Payments Team Primary":
    - Pages whoever's currently on-call (from schedule)
    - Sends push notification + SMS
    - Waits 5 minutes for acknowledgment
  </Step>

  <Step title="Incident created automatically">
    incident.io creates incident channel `#inc-payments-api-high-latency`
    - Posts announcement in `#incidents`
    - Runs workflows
  </Step>

  <Step title="Workflow enriches incident">
    Automated workflow:
    - Looks up payments service in Catalog
    - Assigns service owner as Subject Matter Expert
    - Invites platform team members
    - Creates follow-up action for root cause analysis
  </Step>

  <Step title="On-call engineer responds">
    Engineer acknowledges escalation, joins incident channel, starts investigating.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Team coordinates response">
    - Assign Incident Lead role
    - Share status updates
    - Track actions on timeline
    - Resolve when fixed
  </Step>

  <Step title="Post-incident workflow triggers">
    When resolved:
    - Create post-mortem document
    - Schedule post-mortem meeting
    - Track follow-up actions to completion
  </Step>
</Steps>
