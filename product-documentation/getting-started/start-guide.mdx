# Start Guide

Welcome to incident.io! This guide will walk you through everything you need to get your incident response platform up and running. Whether you're setting up incident management, on-call scheduling, or alert routing, we'll help you build a solid foundation.

## Overview

incident.io is a unified platform for managing the entire lifecycle of incidents in your organization. From receiving alerts and paging on-call engineers, to coordinating response in Slack or Microsoft Teams, to learning from incidents after they're resolved - incident.io brings it all together.

## Initial Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your communication platform">
    incident.io works where your team already collaborates. Start by connecting either Slack or Microsoft Teams.

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Slack">
        1. Navigate to **Settings → Integrations → Slack**
        2. Click **Install Slack app**
        3. Authorize incident.io to access your workspace
        4. Choose your default `#incidents` announcement channel

        <Tip>
          The `#incidents` channel is where incident announcements are posted. Make sure your team has access to this channel.
        </Tip>
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Microsoft Teams">
        1. Navigate to **Settings → Integrations → Microsoft Teams**
        2. Click **Install Teams app**
        3. Authorize incident.io to access your organization
        4. Create an **Incidents** team in Microsoft Teams

        The incident.io app will create incident channels within this team.
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your Catalog">
    The Catalog is your connected map of services, teams, and other resources. It powers routing and automation throughout incident.io.

    **Start with these core types:**

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Services">
        Add the services and systems your team operates:
        
        1. Go to **Catalog → Services**
        2. Click **Add Service**
        3. Fill in service name, description, and owner
        4. Add on-call schedules and escalation paths

        Services can be imported from existing service catalogs like Backstage, Cortex, or OpsLevel.
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Teams">
        Define your organizational teams:
        
        1. Go to **Catalog → Teams**
        2. Click **Add Team**
        3. Add team members and set team leads
        4. Connect teams to the services they own

        Teams can be synced from your HR system or identity provider.
      </Accordion>

      <Accordion title="Custom Types">
        Create catalog types specific to your organization:
        
        - Products or business lines
        - Customers or customer segments
        - Environments (production, staging, etc.)
        - Data pipelines or infrastructure

        Navigate to **Settings → Catalog Types** to create custom types.
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>

    <Note>
      You don't need to populate your entire Catalog before using incident.io. Start with a few key services and expand over time.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up on-call schedules">
    Schedules define who's available to respond at specific times. They power escalations and alert routing.

    1. Navigate to **On-Call → Schedules**
    2. Click **Create Schedule**
    3. Configure your schedule:
       - **Name**: e.g., "Backend Primary"
       - **Timezone**: Your team's primary timezone
       - **Rotation type**: Daily, weekly, or custom
       - **Participants**: Add team members to the rotation
    4. Set up layers for complex coverage (weekday vs. weekend, business hours vs. after-hours)

    <Tip>
      Start with a simple weekly rotation. You can add complexity later as needed.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create escalation paths">
    Escalation paths define how to reach people when something needs attention.

    1. Go to **On-Call → Escalation Paths**
    2. Click **Create Escalation Path**
    3. Add escalation levels:
       - **Level 1**: Page whoever's on-call (reference your schedule)
       - **Level 2**: If no response after 5 minutes, page their manager
       - **Level 3**: Escalate to senior leadership
    4. Configure notification methods (push, SMS, phone call)

    Each level can target schedules, specific people, or Slack/Teams channels.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure alert routing">
    Connect your monitoring tools and define how alerts should be handled.

    1. **Connect monitoring integrations**:
       - Navigate to **Settings → Integrations**
       - Connect tools like Datadog, PagerDuty, Sentry, or Grafana
       - Each integration provides a unique URL for receiving alerts

    2. **Create alert routes**:
       - Go to **Alerts → Alert Routes**
       - Click **Create Alert Route**
       - Define conditions (e.g., "alerts tagged with service:payments")
       - Choose actions:
         - Send to Slack channel for awareness
         - Create escalation to page on-call
         - Automatically create incident for critical issues

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Route to Channel">
        Send alerts to a Slack channel for team awareness:
        
        ```yaml
        Condition: alert.severity = "warning"
        Action: Send to #alerts-backend
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Create Escalation">
        Page the on-call engineer for urgent alerts:
        
        ```yaml
        Condition: alert.priority = "urgent"
        Action: Create escalation → Backend Primary path
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Auto-create Incident">
        Automatically create incidents for critical alerts:
        
        ```yaml
        Condition: alert.severity = "critical"
        Action: Create incident with severity "Major"
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Customize incident forms">
    Forms capture essential information when declaring incidents.

    1. Go to **Settings → Forms**
    2. Configure the **Declare** form:
       - Show/hide fields based on conditions
       - Set required fields
       - Add custom fields (affected services, customer impact, etc.)
    3. Configure other forms:
       - **Accept**: When accepting triage incidents
       - **Update**: When sharing status updates
       - **Resolve**: When closing incidents

    <Warning>
      Don't require too many fields at declaration - it slows down response. Make fields optional initially and required at resolution.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Define incident roles">
    Roles clarify who's responsible for what during incidents.

    1. Navigate to **Settings → Incident Roles**
    2. Configure default roles:
       - **Incident Lead**: Coordinates response (required by default)
       - **Communications Lead**: Handles stakeholder updates
       - **Subject Matter Expert**: Technical specialist
    3. Create custom roles matching your response process
    4. Set role instructions that are sent when someone is assigned

    Each role can be required before resolution to ensure proper coverage.
  </Step>
</Steps>
