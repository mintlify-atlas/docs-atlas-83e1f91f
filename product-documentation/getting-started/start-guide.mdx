# Start Guide

Welcome to incident.io. This guide will walk you through the essential steps to get your incident response platform configured and ready for your team.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Connect your chat platform">
    incident.io works where your team already communicates. Connect Slack or Microsoft Teams to enable incident channels, notifications, and real-time collaboration.
    
    Navigate to **Settings > Integrations** and follow the prompts to authorize incident.io with your workspace.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up your Catalog">
    The Catalog is your organization's context map - services, teams, products, and how they connect. This powers routing and automation throughout incident.io.
    
    Start by defining your core Catalog Types:
    - **Services**: Your applications and infrastructure components
    - **Teams**: Who owns and maintains each service
    - **Products**: Customer-facing offerings that services support
    
    <Info>
      If you use a developer portal like Backstage or Cortex, you can import your existing service catalog directly.
    </Info>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create your first schedule">
    Schedules define who's available to respond at specific times. Set up an on-call rotation for your team.
    
    Go to **On-call > Schedules** and create a schedule with:
    - Rotation frequency (daily, weekly, or custom)
    - Team members in the rotation
    - Time zones and working hours
    - Holiday calendars (optional)
    
    <Tip>
      Start simple with one schedule. You can add complexity like layered schedules or split shifts later.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure alert routing">
    Connect your monitoring tools and define what happens when alerts fire. Alert routes determine whether to send notifications, page someone, or automatically create an incident.
    
    1. Connect your monitoring tools in **Settings > Integrations** (Datadog, PagerDuty, Grafana, etc.)
    2. Create alert routes in **Alerts > Alert routes**
    3. Define actions: notify channels, create escalations, or auto-create incidents
    
    <Note>
      You can group related alerts into the same incident to prevent alert fatigue.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up escalation paths">
    Escalation paths define how to reach people when attention is needed. They connect to your schedules to automatically route notifications to whoever's on-call.
    
    Create paths in **On-call > Escalation paths** with:
    - Target schedules or specific users
    - Notification methods (push, SMS, phone)
    - Wait times before escalating to the next level
    - Conditions for urgent vs. in-hours routing
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test your setup">
    Before going live, verify everything works:
    
    - Create a test incident to confirm channel creation and notifications
    - Send a test alert to verify routing and escalations
    - Check that timeline events are captured correctly
    - Ensure your team members receive notifications on their devices
    
    <Warning>
      Use test mode or clearly label test incidents to avoid confusion with real issues.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
</Steps>
