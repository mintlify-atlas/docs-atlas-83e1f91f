# Start Guide

Welcome to incident.io! This guide will walk you through everything you need to get started with the platform, from initial setup to managing your first incident.

## What is incident.io?

incident.io is a comprehensive incident management platform that brings together on-call management, incident response, and post-incident workflows in one unified system. It helps engineering teams:

- **Respond faster** to incidents with automated coordination and workflows
- **Stay organized** with dedicated incident channels and clear role assignments
- **Learn continuously** from incidents through structured post-mortems and insights
- **Scale effectively** as your organization grows

<Note>
incident.io works where you already collaborate - in Slack or Microsoft Teams - so your team can respond to incidents without context switching.
</Note>

## Getting started in 4 steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install incident.io">
    Connect incident.io to your Slack workspace or Microsoft Teams organization. This takes just a few minutes and requires admin permissions.
    
    The installation process will:
    - Add the incident.io bot to your workspace
    - Set up necessary permissions for channel management
    - Create your organization's incident.io dashboard
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure your Catalog">
    The [Catalog](/product-documentation/getting-started/concepts#catalog) is your organizational map - it helps incident.io understand your services, teams, and how they relate.
    
    Start by adding:
    - **Services**: Your applications, APIs, and infrastructure components
    - **Teams**: Who owns and operates different parts of your system
    - **Connections**: How services and teams relate to each other
    
    <Info>
    Already have a service catalog? Import directly from Backstage, Cortex, or other tools to get started quickly.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set up on-call schedules">
    Create [schedules](/product-documentation/on-call/schedules-overview) to define who's available to respond to alerts and incidents.
    
    Configure:
    - **Rotation patterns**: Daily, weekly, or custom rotations
    - **Time zones**: Support distributed teams across different locations
    - **Coverage gaps**: Layer multiple schedules for 24/7 coverage
    - **Calendar integration**: Automatically handle time off and holidays
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create your first incident">
    You're ready to respond! Create an incident from:
    - Slack or Teams using the `/incident` command
    - The incident.io dashboard
    - Automatically from alerts
    
    incident.io will:
    - Create a dedicated incident channel
    - Set up the incident timeline
    - Prompt for key context using your custom forms
    - Notify relevant stakeholders based on severity
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Core workflows to configure

Once you've completed the basics, enhance your setup with these powerful features:

## Key concepts to understand

As you get started, these concepts form the foundation of how incident.io works:

### Incidents vs. Alerts

- **Alerts** are automated signals from monitoring systems - they notify you something is wrong
- **Incidents** are coordinated human responses - they're where your team works together to fix the problem

Alerts can trigger incidents, but not every alert needs to become an incident. Configure [alert routes](/product-documentation/on-call/alert-routing) to decide when alerts should escalate to full incident response.

### Lifecycle management

Incidents flow through clear stages:

1. **Triage**: Initial assessment - what's broken and how bad is it?
2. **Active**: Response is underway - team is investigating and fixing
3. **Post-incident**: Issue is resolved - time to learn and document
4. **Closed**: Fully complete with follow-ups done

Each stage has different workflows, nudges, and expectations to keep incidents moving forward.

### Roles and responsibilities

Clear roles prevent confusion during incidents:

- **Incident Lead**: Coordinates the response and makes decisions
- **Communications Lead**: Manages stakeholder updates
- **Technical responders**: Investigate and implement fixes

You can customize roles to match your organization's structure and assign them automatically through workflows.

## Best practices for getting started

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start small and iterate">
    Don't try to configure everything at once. Start with:
    1. One or two critical services in your Catalog
    2. A basic on-call schedule for your primary team
    3. Simple alert routing for your most important monitors
    
    You can expand and refine as you learn what works for your team.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test with a practice incident">
    Before your first real incident, run through the process:
    - Create a test incident
    - Assign roles
    - Send a status update
    - Close the incident properly
    
    This helps your team get comfortable with the workflow when there's no pressure.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Customize for your culture">
    incident.io is flexible by design. Adapt it to match how your team works:
    - Use your own severity levels and terminology
    - Create custom fields to capture context that matters to you
    - Build workflows that enforce your specific processes
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Enable learning, not just response">
    The real value comes from getting better over time:
    - Use post-incident workflows to ensure follow-ups happen
    - Review incident metrics to spot patterns
    - Share learnings across teams through post-mortems
