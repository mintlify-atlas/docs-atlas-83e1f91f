# Quick Start Tutorial

This hands-on guide walks you through creating and managing your first incident in incident.io. By the end, you'll understand the core workflow and be ready to handle real incidents with confidence.

<Note>
**Time to complete:** 20-30 minutes

**Prerequisites:**
- incident.io installed in your Slack workspace or Microsoft Teams
- Admin access to your incident.io dashboard
</Note>

## Step 1: Set up your profile

Before jumping into incidents, let's make sure you can be reached when needed.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add your contact methods">
    Navigate to **Settings > My Profile** in the incident.io dashboard.
    
    Add:
    - **Phone number** for SMS and voice calls
    - **Push notification** preferences via the mobile app
    - **Time zone** so on-call schedules work correctly
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Install the mobile app (optional)">
    Download the incident.io mobile app from the App Store or Google Play to:
    - Receive push notifications for alerts and incidents
    - Acknowledge escalations from anywhere
    - View and update incidents on the go
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Explore the Catalog

The Catalog is your organizational knowledge base. Let's add your first service.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the Catalog">
    Go to **Catalog** in your incident.io dashboard. You'll see default catalog types:
    - Services
    - Teams
    - Users (automatically imported from Slack/Teams)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create a test service">
    Click **Add entry** in the Services catalog:
    
    ```
    Name: API Gateway
    Description: Main API gateway handling customer requests
    On-call team: [Your team]
    Status: Active
    ```
    
    <Info>
    In production, you'll add all your critical services. For now, one service is enough to practice with.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Link a team">
    In the Teams catalog, ensure your team exists. If not, create one:
    
    ```
    Name: Platform Team
    Slack channel: #platform
    Members: [Add yourself and teammates]
    ```
    
    Link this team to your service by editing the service's "On-call team" field.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 3: Create a simple on-call schedule

Let's set up a basic schedule so you can test alert routing and escalations.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your first schedule">
    Navigate to **On-call > Schedules** and click **New schedule**:
    
    ```
    Name: Platform On-call
    Time zone: [Your time zone]
    Rotation type: Weekly
    Handoff time: 9:00 AM Monday
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add yourself to the rotation">
    Add a layer to your schedule:
    - Click **Add layer**
    - Select **Weekly rotation**
    - Add yourself as the first person
    - Set coverage to **24/7** (or restrict to business hours for testing)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify you're on-call">
    Check the schedule preview - you should see yourself listed as currently on-call.
    
    <Info>
    The person "on-call" is the first responder when alerts fire or incidents need attention.
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 4: Create your first incident

Time to experience the incident workflow from the responder's perspective.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start an incident from Slack">
    In any Slack channel, type:
    
    ```
    /incident
    ```
    
    This opens the incident creation modal.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Fill in incident details">
    Complete the form:
    
    ```
    Title: API Gateway Returning 500 Errors
    Severity: Minor (this is just a test)
    Summary: Elevated error rate detected on main API gateway
    Affected service: API Gateway (select from catalog)
    ```
    
    <Note>
    In a real incident, severity determines who gets notified and how urgently. For this test, use Minor to avoid unnecessary alerts.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Watch the incident channel get created">
    When you click **Create incident**, incident.io automatically:
    - Creates a dedicated Slack channel (e.g., `#inc-123-api-gateway-500-errors`)
    - Posts an initial status message
    - Starts the incident timeline
    - Invites you to the channel
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 5: Work the incident

Now let's explore what happens during active incident response.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Assign the Incident Lead role">
    In the incident channel, incident.io will prompt you to assign roles.
    
    Click **Assign roles** and set:
    - **Incident Lead**: Yourself
    - **Communications Lead**: (optional for now)
    
    <Info>
    The Incident Lead coordinates the response and makes key decisions. In real incidents, this might be the on-call engineer or an experienced team member.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create an action item">
    Practice creating follow-up tasks. In the channel, type:
    
    ```
    Check API gateway logs for error patterns
    ```
    
    React to your message with the 👉 emoji. incident.io converts it into a tracked action item.
    
    Try:
    - Assigning the action to yourself
    - Marking it as complete with ✅
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Post a status update">
    Keep stakeholders informed. Type in the channel:
    
    ```
    /incident update
    ```
    
    Fill in the update form:
    
    ```
    Message: Investigating elevated 500 errors. Initial analysis suggests database connection issues.
    Affected users: Minimal impact
    ```
    
    Status updates can be shared to:
    - Slack channels (e.g., #incidents)
    - Status pages
    - Custom Slack notifications
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Update incident severity (optional)">
    If the situation changes, you can escalate:
    
    ```
    /incident severity major
    ```
    
    This would trigger additional notifications based on your configuration.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 6: Resolve and close the incident

Time to wrap up your test incident.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Mark the incident as resolved">
    When the issue is fixed (or in this case, when you're done testing), type:
    
    ```
    /incident resolve
    ```
    
    Add a resolution message:
    
    ```
    Test incident completed. Issue was simulated for training purposes.
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review the incident timeline">
    Before closing, check the timeline:
    - Click **View timeline** in the channel
    - See all events: creation, role assignments, actions, updates, resolution
    
    <Info>
    The timeline is automatically generated and becomes invaluable for post-incident reviews.
    </Info>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Close the incident">
    When all follow-up actions are complete:
    
    ```
    /incident close
    ```
    
    This:
    - Archives the incident channel
    - Finalizes the timeline
    - Triggers any post-incident workflows (like post-mortem creation)
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Step 7: Explore post-incident features

incident.io helps you learn from every incident.

<Steps>
  <Step title="View the incident in the dashboard">
    Navigate to **Incidents** in your dashboard and find your test incident.
    
    Explore:
    - Complete timeline of all events
    - Assigned actions and their status
    - Time to resolve metrics
    - Links to related incidents (if any)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Check the post-mortem (if configured)">
    If you have post-incident workflows enabled, a post-mortem document may have been created automatically.
    
    Post-mortems include:
    - Incident summary and timeline
    - Root cause analysis
    - Action items to prevent recurrence
    - Links to relevant resources
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review insights (optional)">
    Navigate to **Insights** to see how incidents are tracked over time:
    - Total incidents by severity
    - Mean time to resolve
    - Top affected services
    - Action item completion rates
  </Step>
</Steps>
