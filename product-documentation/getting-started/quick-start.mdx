## Practice makes perfect

<Warning>
  Run practice incidents regularly to keep your team sharp and find gaps in your configuration before real incidents happen.
</Warning>

Schedule monthly practice runs:
1. Create a test incident during business hours
2. Walk through your incident response process
3. Test escalations and verify people get notifications
4. Review what worked and what needs adjustment
