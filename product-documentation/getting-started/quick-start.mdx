    </Tabs>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Declare your first test incident">
    **Create a test incident** (2 minutes)
    
    Let's verify everything works with a test incident:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="From Slack">
        1. In any Slack channel, type `/incident` and press **Enter**
        2. Fill in the incident form:
           - **What's going on?**: "Test incident - ignore"
           - **Severity**: Select your lowest severity
           - **Status**: Choose **Active incident**
        3. Click **Declare incident**

        <Tip>
          Use the shortcut `/inc` instead of `/incident` to save time.
        </Tip>
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="From Microsoft Teams">
        1. Open the **Incidents** team
        2. Go to the **General** channel
        3. Click the **incident.io** tab
        4. Fill in the incident form:
           - **What's going on?**: "Test incident - ignore"
           - **Severity**: Select your lowest severity
           - **Status**: Choose **Active incident**
        5. Click **Declare incident**
      </Tab>

      <Tab title="From Web Dashboard">
        1. Visit [app.incident.io/declare](https://app.incident.io/declare)
        2. At the top of the form, select **Test incident**
        3. Fill in basic information:
           - **What's going on?**: "Test incident - ignore"
           - **Severity**: Select your lowest severity
        4. Click **Declare incident**

        <Info>
          Test incidents are clearly marked and don't affect your metrics or analytics.
        </Info>
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>

    **What happens next:**

    - A dedicated incident channel is created (e.g., `#inc-test-incident-ignore`)
    - An announcement is posted in your `#incidents` channel
    - A timeline starts tracking all incident activity
  </Step>

  <Step title="Assign an incident lead">
    **Set incident roles** (1 minute)

    Every incident needs someone coordinating the response:

    1. In your new incident channel, type `/inc roles`
    2. Click **Assign** next to **Incident Lead**
    3. Select yourself or a team member
    4. Click **Assign role**

    The assigned person receives a private message with instructions on their responsibilities.

    <Tip>
      Quick assignment: Type `/inc role lead @username` to assign the lead role directly.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Share a status update">
    **Communicate progress** (1 minute)

    Keep stakeholders informed:

    1. In the incident channel, type `/inc update`
    2. Fill in the update form:
       - **Message**: "This is a test - everything is working correctly"
       - **Affected**: No customers affected (if prompted)
    3. Click **Share update**

    The update posts to:
    - The incident channel timeline
    - The announcement in `#incidents` (as a reply)
    - Any configured status pages
  </Step>

  <Step title="Resolve the incident">
    **Close it out** (1 minute)

    Once your test is complete:

    1. Type `/inc resolve` in the incident channel
    2. Add a resolution note: "Test completed successfully"
    3. Click **Resolve**

    The incident moves to **Resolved** status. The channel remains available for post-incident activities.

    <Info>
      Resolving an incident doesn't delete the channel. It preserves all context and triggers post-incident workflows.
    </Info>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Check>
  **Congratulations!** You've completed your first incident flow. Your team can now declare incidents, assign responsibilities, share updates, and track resolutions.

    Severity indicates how serious an incident is. Most organizations use 3-5 levels:

    - **Critical/SEV1**: Complete outage, all customers affected
    - **Major/SEV2**: Significant degradation, many customers affected
    - **Minor/SEV3**: Limited impact, small number of customers affected

    Configure your severity levels at **Settings → Severities**.

    2. Click the **⋮** menu in the top right
