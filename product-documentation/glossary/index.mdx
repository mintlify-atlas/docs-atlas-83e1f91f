  This glossary covers key terminology used across incident management, on-call operations, alerts, and the incident.io platform.
</Info>

## A

<Accordion title="@incident">

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Alert">
  Automated event from a monitoring system signaling something unusual or problematic was detected. Alerts can be routed to create incidents or page on-call engineers.
</Accordion>

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Alert route">

  Integration that sends alerts (monitoring systems, webhooks, email, etc.). Common sources include Datadog, PagerDuty, Sentry, and custom webhooks.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Alias">
