title: Enrich incidents with context
description: Automatically surface relevant information from Catalog when incidents are created.
---

Incident enrichment automatically adds context from your Catalog to incidents, surfacing ownership, runbooks, dependencies, and other critical information exactly when responders need it.

Instead of searching for service owners, runbook links, or on-call engineers during an incident, enrichment workflows pull this data from Catalog and post it directly to incident channels.

## Why enrich incidents?

**Faster response**
Responders immediately see who owns the affected service, how to page them, and where to find runbooks - no searching required.

**Consistent context**
Every incident includes the same structured information, ensuring responders always know what's available.

**Reduced cognitive load**
Automated context means responders focus on fixing the problem, not finding information.

**Better decisions**
Surfacing dependencies, customer impact, and historical patterns helps teams make informed choices quickly.

## What context can you enrich?

Any information in your Catalog can be surfaced in incidents:

### Service information
- Owner team and current on-call engineers
- Service description and documentation links
- Runbook URLs for common issues
- Monitoring dashboard and logging links
- Recent deployment history
- Service tier and SLA commitments

### Ownership and escalation
- Team Slack channels
- Escalation paths and paging instructions
- Team leads and technical experts
- Business hours and timezone coverage

### Dependencies and relationships  
- Upstream and downstream service dependencies
- Related services and infrastructure
- Affected products or customer-facing features
- Regional or datacenter context

### Customer impact
- Affected customers and their tier
- Account managers and CSM team
- Customer-specific SLAs
- Recent customer interactions or complaints

### Historical patterns
- Similar past incidents
- Known issues and workarounds
- Recent alerts from the same service
- Ongoing maintenance or deploys

## Setting up incident enrichment

Enrichment uses workflows that trigger when incidents are created or updated.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Ensure Catalog data is complete">
    Verify your Catalog has the information you want to surface:
    - Services have owners, runbook links, documentation URLs
    - Teams have escalation paths and Slack channels
    - Relationships are mapped (services → teams, services → dependencies)
    
    Navigate to **Catalog** and audit key types for completeness.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create a custom field for context selection">
    Add a custom field that references the Catalog type you want to enrich from.
    
    Example: "Affected Service" field linking to Services catalog type
    
    Go to **Settings → Custom Fields → Create custom field**:
    - Name: "Affected Service"
    - Type: Link to Catalog
    - Links to: Services
    - Required: Yes (at creation)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create enrichment workflow">
    Go to **Workflows → Create workflow**
    
    **Trigger:** When an incident is created or changed
    
    **Conditions:** 
    - Affected Service is set
    - Affected Service changed (to avoid re-posting on every update)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add workflow steps to post context">
    Add a step to send a message to the incident channel with Catalog data.
    
    **Step:** Send message to incident channel
    
    **Message template:**
    ```
    **Service Information**
    
    **Service:** {{incident.custom_fields.affected_service.name}}
    **Owner:** {{incident.custom_fields.affected_service.owner.name}}
    **On-call:** {{incident.custom_fields.affected_service.owner.current_oncall}}
    **Runbook:** {{incident.custom_fields.affected_service.runbook_url}}
    **Docs:** {{incident.custom_fields.affected_service.docs_url}}
    **Dashboard:** {{incident.custom_fields.affected_service.dashboard_url}}
    
    **Dependencies:** {{incident.custom_fields.affected_service.depends_on | join: ", "}}
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Test the workflow">
    Click **Test** in the workflow editor and select a test incident.
    
    Verify the message includes correct data from Catalog.
    
    Adjust the template as needed for your organization's Catalog structure.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Activate the workflow">
    Click **Activate** to enable enrichment for all future incidents.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Enrichment patterns

### Basic service context

Post essential service information when incidents are created:

```
Trigger: Incident is created
Condition: Affected Service is set

Step: Send message to incident channel
  **{{incident.custom_fields.affected_service.name}}** incident
  
  Owner: {{incident.service.owner.name}}
  On-call: {{incident.service.owner.current_oncall}}
  Runbook: {{incident.service.runbook_url}}
  
  Need to escalate? Use `/inc escalate`
```

This gives responders immediate context without searching.

### Dependency awareness

Surface upstream and downstream dependencies:

```
Trigger: Incident is created
Condition: Affected Service is set

Step: Send message to incident channel
  **Service dependencies for {{incident.service.name}}:**
  
  Depends on: {{incident.service.depends_on | join: ", "}}
  Used by: {{incident.service.used_by | join: ", "}}
  
  Impact may extend to downstream services.
```

Teams immediately understand potential blast radius.

### Customer impact notification

When customer is affected, show account context:

```
Trigger: Incident is created or changed
Condition: Affected Customer is set

Step: Send message to incident channel
  **Customer impact:** {{incident.custom_fields.affected_customer.name}}
  
  Tier: {{incident.customer.tier}}
  Account Manager: {{incident.customer.account_manager.name}}
  CSM Team: {{incident.customer.csm_team.name}}
  SLA: {{incident.customer.sla_hours}} hour response time
  
  Consider notifying {{incident.customer.account_manager}} via DM.
```

Customer context helps teams prioritize and communicate appropriately.

### Runbook suggestions based on alerts

If the incident was created from an alert, suggest relevant runbooks:

```
Trigger: Incident is created
Condition: Created from alert AND Alert type is set

Expression: Relevant Runbook
  If: alert.type == "HighErrorRate"
    Return: "https://docs.example.com/runbooks/high-error-rate"
  Else if: alert.type == "DatabaseConnectionFailure"  
    Return: "https://docs.example.com/runbooks/db-connections"
  Else:
    Return: incident.service.runbook_url

Step: Send message to incident channel
  **Suggested runbook:** {{expression.relevant_runbook}}
  
  This runbook covers common causes and mitigation steps for {{alert.type}} alerts.
```

Context-specific guidance accelerates initial response.

### Historical incident links

Surface similar past incidents using Catalog relationships:

```
Trigger: Incident is created
Condition: Affected Service is set

Step: Query recent incidents
  Filter: Affected Service = {{incident.service}} AND Created within last 30 days
  
Step: Send message to incident channel (if query returned results)
  **Recent incidents affecting {{incident.service.name}}:**
  
  {{query_results | join: "\n"}}
  
  Check these for context or related issues.
```

Teams can learn from recent response patterns.

### Regional context for global services

If services run in multiple regions, surface regional information:

```
Trigger: Incident is created
Condition: Affected Service is set AND Service region is set

Step: Send message to incident channel
  **Regional context:**
  
  Service: {{incident.service.name}}
  Region: {{incident.service.region.name}}
  Regional on-call: {{incident.service.region.oncall_team.current_oncall}}
  Timezone: {{incident.service.region.timezone}}
  
  Current time in region: {{incident.service.region | current_time}}
```

Helps coordinate across timezones.

## Advanced enrichment techniques

### Conditional context based on severity

Post different information for different severities:

```
Trigger: Incident is created
Condition: Affected Service is set

Expression: Context Message
  If: incident.severity == "Critical"
    Return: [
      "Owner: {{service.owner}}",
      "On-call: {{service.owner.current_oncall}}",
      "Escalation: {{service.owner.escalation_path}}",
      "Executive contact: {{service.owner.director}}",
      "PR team: {{service.pr_contact}}"
    ]
  Else:
    Return: [
      "Owner: {{service.owner}}",
      "Runbook: {{service.runbook_url}}"
    ]

Step: Send message
  {{expression.context_message | join: "\n"}}
```

Critical incidents get escalation paths; lower severity gets runbooks.

### Aggregate context from multiple services

When incidents affect multiple services, aggregate their context:

```
Trigger: Incident is created
Condition: Affected Services is set (multi-select field)

Step: Create loop over Affected Services
  For each service:
    Step: Send message to incident channel
      **{{service.name}}**
      Owner: {{service.owner}}
      Runbook: {{service.runbook_url}}
      
      ---
```

All affected service context in one place.

### Enrich with external data via API

Pull real-time data from monitoring or other systems:

```
Trigger: Incident is created
Condition: Affected Service is set

Step: HTTP request
  URL: https://monitoring.example.com/api/service/{{incident.service.external_id}}/metrics
  Method: GET
  
Step: Send message to incident channel
  **Current metrics for {{incident.service.name}}:**
  
  Error rate: {{http_response.error_rate}}%
  Latency p99: {{http_response.latency_p99}}ms
  Request rate: {{http_response.requests_per_minute}} req/min
  
  Dashboard: {{incident.service.dashboard_url}}
```

Live metrics alongside static Catalog context.

### Create pinned Slack bookmarks

Add Catalog links as channel bookmarks for easy access:

```
Trigger: Incident is created  
Condition: Affected Service is set

Step: Add Slack bookmark
  Title: "{{incident.service.name}} Runbook"
  URL: {{incident.service.runbook_url}}
  
Step: Add Slack bookmark
  Title: "Dashboard"  
  URL: {{incident.service.dashboard_url}}
  
Step: Add Slack bookmark
  Title: "Recent Deployments"
  URL: {{incident.service.deploy_log_url}}
```

Context available in channel bookmarks bar.

## Maintaining enrichment quality

### Keep Catalog data current

Enrichment is only valuable if Catalog data is accurate:

**Automated syncs**
- Connect service catalogs (Backstage, Cortex) to pull ownership and metadata
- Sync from git repositories for runbook and documentation links
- Pull deployment data from CI/CD systems

**Regular audits**
- Review services without runbook links quarterly
- Flag services without owners
- Update stale documentation URLs

**In-incident validation**
Add a workflow step that asks responders to verify context:
```
Step: Send message
  Is this information correct? React with ✅ if yes, ❌ if it needs updating:
  Owner: {{service.owner}}
  Runbook: {{service.runbook_url}}
```

Capture when data is wrong during incidents when it matters.

### Template enrichment messages thoughtfully

**Use formatting for scannability**
- Bold key labels
- Use line breaks to separate sections
- Link URLs instead of showing full paths

**Prioritize actionable information**
- On-call contact before documentation links
- Runbooks before general docs
- Escalation paths before organizational structure

**Handle missing data gracefully**
- Use conditional rendering: `{{"{{#if service.runbook_url}}Runbook: {{service.runbook_url}}{{/if}}"}}`
- Provide fallbacks: "No runbook available - check `{{service.docs_url}}`"
- Don't show empty fields that clutter the message

### Avoid enrichment overload

More context isn't always better:

- Limit enrichment messages to 1-2 per incident creation
- Combine related information in a single message
- Use threads or bookmarks for supplementary context
- Post only what's immediately actionable

Respect responders' attention during high-pressure situations.

## Measuring enrichment effectiveness

Track whether enrichment improves response:

**Time to engage**
Measure time from incident creation to first response. If enrichment works, this should decrease - responders have what they need immediately.

**Escalation patterns**
Check if fewer incidents require manual escalation to find owners. Good enrichment surfaces ownership automatically.

**Follow-up questions**
Monitor incident channels for questions like "who owns this?" or "where's the runbook?" Enrichment should eliminate these.

**Responder feedback**
Periodically ask responders:
- Is the enrichment information useful?
- What's missing that you frequently search for?
- Is there too much or too little information?

Adjust enrichment workflows based on feedback.

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can enrichment update incident fields automatically?">
    Yes. Instead of posting a message, use an "Update incident" step:

    ```
    Step: Update incident
      Custom field "Owner Team" = incident.service.owner
      Custom field "Service Tier" = incident.service.tier
    ```

    This populates fields from Catalog without manual input.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if Catalog data is missing for an incident?">
    Use workflow conditions to handle missing data:

    ```
    Condition: Affected Service is set AND Service owner is not set
    
    Step: Send message
      ⚠️ No owner found for {{service.name}} in Catalog.
      Please assign an owner at [Catalog link].
    ```

    This flags data quality issues when they impact response.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I enrich private incidents differently?">
    Yes. Use incident visibility in workflow conditions:

    ```
    Condition: Incident visibility is "Private"
    
    Step: Send message
      [Enrichment with sensitive information]
    ```

    Separate workflows for public vs. private incidents.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I enrich incidents created from alerts?">
    Use alert attributes in enrichment workflows:

    ```
    Trigger: Incident is created
    Condition: Created from alert
    
    Step: Send message
      Alert type: {{incident.origin_alert.type}}
      Alert priority: {{incident.origin_alert.priority}}
      Service: {{incident.origin_alert.service.name}}
      Owner: {{incident.origin_alert.service.owner}}
    ```

    Alert context plus Catalog context together.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can enrichment run when incidents are updated, not just created?">
    Yes. Use trigger conditions:

    ```
    Trigger: Incident is created or changed
    Condition: Affected Service changed
    ```

    This re-enriches when the affected service is updated mid-incident.
