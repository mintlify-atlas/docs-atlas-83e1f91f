title: Enrich Incidents with Context
description: Automatically bring relevant context, people, and resources into incidents using catalog data
---

## Overview

The true power of Catalog emerges when you use it to automatically enrich incidents with the right context, notify the right people, and provide access to the right resources - all based on what's selected during incident declaration.

By combining catalog data with custom fields and workflows, you can transform a simple "Service X is down" incident into a fully contextualized response with:

- The right team members already in the channel
- Links to relevant dashboards and runbooks
- Customer impact automatically calculated
- Stakeholders proactively notified
- Appropriate escalation policies engaged

<Info>
**From manual to automatic**

Without Catalog: Responders manually figure out who to page, which Slack channel to use, which customers are affected, and which dashboards to check.

With Catalog: Select the affected service once, and incident.io automatically handles all of the above.
</Info>

## How incident enrichment works

Incident enrichment flows through three connected systems:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Custom fields capture structured data">
    During incident declaration, responders select catalog-backed custom fields:
    - Affected Service
    - Affected Customers
    - Impacted Feature
    
    These selections provide the foundation for enrichment.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Catalog relationships provide context">
    incident.io navigates catalog relationships to discover:
    - Service → Owning Team → Team Members
    - Service → Escalation Policy
    - Customers → Account Managers
    - Service → Monitoring Dashboards
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Workflows execute enrichment actions">
    Automated workflows use the catalog data to:
    - Invite team members to the incident channel
    - Page the on-call engineer
    - Notify account managers
    - Post dashboard links
    - Create follow-up tasks
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Common enrichment patterns

### Automatic team mobilization

**Goal:** Get the right people involved immediately

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create custom field">
    Create an "Affected Service" custom field backed by your Services catalog type
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set up relationships">
    Ensure Services have relationships to:
    - Owning Team
    - Tech Lead
    - On-call Escalation Policy
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create workflow">
    Build a workflow triggered on incident creation that:
    
    **Condition:** When Affected Service is set
    
    **Steps:**
    1. Invite Team Members to incident channel
       - Use expression: `Affected Service → Owning Team → Team Members`
    2. Escalate to PagerDuty
       - Use expression: `Affected Service → Owning Team → Escalation Policy`
    3. Send DM to Tech Lead
       - Use expression: `Affected Service → Tech Lead`
       - Message: "Your service {Affected Service} is experiencing an incident"
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Result:** When someone declares an incident affecting "Checkout API", the Payments team members are invited, the payments on-call is paged, and the tech lead receives a direct message - all automatically.

### Customer impact notification

**Goal:** Alert account managers when their customers are affected

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create custom field">
    Create an "Affected Customers" multi-select custom field backed by your Customers catalog type
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set up relationships">
    Ensure Customers have relationships to:
    - Account Manager
    - Customer Tier (VIP, Enterprise, Standard)
    - Annual Contract Value
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create workflow with loop">
    Build a workflow triggered on incident creation:
    
    **Condition:** When Affected Customers is set AND Severity is High or Critical
    
    **Steps:**
    1. Create a loop over "Affected Customers"
    2. For each customer:
       - Send DM to Account Manager
         - Use expression: `Each Affected Customer → Account Manager`
         - Message: "Your customer {Each Affected Customer} is impacted by incident #{Incident Number}"
       - If Customer Tier is VIP:
         - Post to #leadership channel
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Result:** High-severity incidents automatically notify all account managers for affected customers, and VIP customer impacts are escalated to leadership.

### Contextual information delivery

**Goal:** Provide responders with relevant links and documentation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add attributes to services">
    In your Services catalog type, add attributes for:
    - Monitoring Dashboard URL
    - Runbook URL
    - Repository URL
    - Slack Channel
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create workflow">
    Build a workflow triggered on incident creation:
    
    **Condition:** When Affected Service is set
    
    **Steps:**
    1. Post message to incident channel
       - Message template:
       ```
       📊 Monitoring: {Affected Service → Monitoring Dashboard}
       📖 Runbook: {Affected Service → Runbook URL}
       💻 Code: {Affected Service → Repository URL}
       💬 Team: {Affected Service → Slack Channel}
       ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Result:** Every incident has immediate access to monitoring dashboards, runbooks, code repositories, and team channels for the affected service.

### Multi-layer escalation

**Goal:** Escalate through appropriate channels based on incident attributes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up catalog hierarchy">
    Create structure:
    - Service → Team → Division → Executive
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create tiered workflow">
    Build a workflow triggered on severity changes:
    
    **Conditions and steps:**
    
    If Severity becomes High:
    - Escalate to `Affected Service → Owning Team → Escalation Policy`
    - Notify `Affected Service → Owning Team → Team Lead`
    
    If Severity becomes Critical:
    - Escalate to `Affected Service → Owning Team → Division → Director`
    - Post to `#engineering-leadership`
    
    If Severity becomes Major:
    - Notify `Affected Service → Owning Team → Division → Executive`
    - Create Zoom meeting
    - Post to `#exec-team`
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Result:** Escalation automatically follows your organizational hierarchy based on incident severity.

## Advanced enrichment techniques

### Aggregated impact calculation

**Scenario:** Track total affected customer value

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add financial data to customers">
    Add "Annual Contract Value" attribute to Customers catalog type
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create expression for total value">
    Create an expression that sums:
    - `Affected Customers → Annual Contract Value`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create conditional workflow">
    If total value exceeds threshold (e.g., $1M):
    - Notify executive team
    - Create high-priority escalation
    - Update incident severity recommendation
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Service dependency impact

**Scenario:** Automatically identify downstream service impacts

<Steps>
  <Step title="Model dependencies">
    Add "Depends On" relationship to Services:
    - Frontend API → Backend API, Auth Service
    - Backend API → Database, Cache
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create dependent service field">
    Create automated multi-select custom field:
    - "Potentially Affected Services"
    - Expression: `Affected Service → (reverse lookup) Services that depend on this`
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Notify dependent teams">
    Create workflow loop:
    - For each Potentially Affected Service
    - Notify the service's owning team
    - Post warning in the team's Slack channel
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Geographic impact tracking

**Scenario:** Track regional impact for multi-region services

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add region data">
    Create catalog structure:
    - Regions catalog type (US-East, EU-West, etc.)
    - Services → Available In Regions
    - Customers → Primary Region
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create region workflow">
    When Affected Service and Region are set:
    - Filter Affected Customers to those in affected region
    - Update status page for that region
    - Notify regional operations team
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Enrichment with status pages

Catalog can power status page sub-pages for regional or product-specific status reporting.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set up sub-pages">
    Create status page sub-pages for:
    - Different geographic regions
    - Different product lines
    - Different customer tiers
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Link catalog to sub-pages">
    Associate services with sub-pages:
    - API Service → US Status Page, EU Status Page
    - Mobile App → Consumer Status Page
    - Admin Dashboard → Enterprise Status Page
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create auto-update workflow">
    When incident is created:
    - Use expression: `Affected Service → Status Page Sub-pages`
    - Post update to all relevant sub-pages automatically
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Result:** Status updates automatically route to the correct regional or product-specific status pages based on the affected service.

## Measuring enrichment impact

Track these metrics to quantify the value of catalog-powered enrichment:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Time to engagement" icon="clock">
    **Before:** Time from incident declaration to key responder joining
    
    **After:** Should decrease significantly with auto-invites
    
    **Target:** <2 minutes for auto-invited responders
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Manual lookups" icon="magnifying-glass">
    **Before:** Messages like "who owns this service?" or "what's the runbook?"
    
    **After:** Should decrease as context is auto-provided
    
    **Target:** Zero lookup questions for enriched services
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Incorrect escalations" icon="triangle-exclamation">
    **Before:** Incidents escalated to wrong team or person
    
    **After:** Should decrease with automated routing
    
    **Target:** <5% incorrect auto-escalations
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Time to resolution" icon="stopwatch">
    **Before:** Full incident lifecycle time
    
    **After:** Should decrease as right people engaged faster
    
    **Target:** 20-30% improvement for enriched incident types
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Too many people auto-invited" icon="users">
    **Problem:** Incident channels are crowded with unnecessary participants
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Refine catalog relationships to specific roles (e.g., "Primary On-call" not "All Team Members")
    - Use severity-based conditions (only invite full team for Critical incidents)
    - Add opt-in mechanisms for secondary responders
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Important people missed" icon="user-slash">
    **Problem:** Key responders aren't being automatically added
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Audit catalog data - is the relationship defined?
    - Check workflow conditions - are they too restrictive?
    - Add fallback rules (e.g., if no service owner, invite director)
    - Create manual escalation options
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Wrong context provided" icon="link-slash">
    **Problem:** Auto-posted links or information are incorrect
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Update catalog data at the source
    - Add validation to catalog entries (required fields)
    - Regular data quality audits
    - Clear ownership of catalog maintenance
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Enrichment not triggering" icon="play-slash">
    **Problem:** Workflow isn't running for some incidents
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Check workflow conditions match incident attributes
    - Verify custom fields are being set during declaration
    - Review workflow run history for errors
    - Ensure workflow is set to "Live" not "Draft"
