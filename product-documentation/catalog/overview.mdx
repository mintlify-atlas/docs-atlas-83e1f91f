## What is Catalog?

The Catalog is a connected map of everything that exists in your organization. It's a central repository that you can easily navigate and is available across features like Workflows, Insights, and Triggers to level up your incident response.

By bringing structured data about your services, teams, customers, and other resources into incident.io, you can automate incident response workflows, reduce manual overhead, and ensure the right people are involved at the right time.

<Info>
**Why use Catalog?**

With great catalog data, you can automatically bring in the teams and individuals responsible for resolving incidents and communicating with stakeholders - reducing the cognitive load on responders during high-stress situations.

## Key capabilities

Catalog enables you to:

## Common catalog types

Most organizations will want to model these core catalog types:

### Services or Features

In large organizations, it's unreasonable to expect someone declaring an incident to know exactly who to escalate to. By adding a catalog type for services or features, responders can simply select what's impacted and escalation happens automatically based on the owning team.

**Common attributes:**
- Name and description
- Owning team(s)
- On-call escalation policy
- Repository links
- Monitoring dashboards

### Teams

Teams are the backbone of incident response. Model your teams in catalog to enable automatic routing and filtering.

**Common attributes:**
- Team name and description
- Team members
- Team lead or manager
- Slack channel
- Escalation policy
- Services owned

<Note>
Learn more about setting up teams in our [Getting started with teams](/help-centre/catalog/getting-started-with-teams) guide.
</Note>

### Customers

Knowing which customers are affected helps you prioritize incidents and notify the right stakeholders.

**Common attributes:**
- Customer name
- Pricing tier or package
- Customer Success Manager
- Account value
- Support priority level

### Custom types for your business

The real power of Catalog comes from modeling domain-specific resources that matter to your organization:

- **E-commerce**: Products, warehouses, fulfillment centers
- **Financial services**: Trading systems, clearing houses, compliance systems
- **Infrastructure**: Data centers, regions, availability zones
- **Healthcare**: Facilities, departments, medical systems

## Getting data into Catalog

There are four main ways to populate your catalog:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Native integrations">
    Connect incident.io to tools you already use. We'll automatically sync data once per day from integrations like:
    - GitHub (repositories)
    - PagerDuty (services, teams, escalation policies)
    - Backstage
    - Cortex
    - Datadog
    - OpsLevel
    - And more at [incident.io/integrations](https://incident.io/integrations)
    
    **Effort required:** Minimal - most integrations are one-click setups
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Catalog Importer">
    For maximum control and flexibility, use our [catalog importer](https://github.com/incident-io/catalog-importer) to sync data from any source on your own schedule.
    
    Perfect for:
    - Large datasets
    - Tools without native integrations
    - Complex relationship mapping
    - Custom sync frequencies
    
    **Effort required:** Moderate technical lift, but highly worthwhile for the impact on MTTX (mean time to X) metrics
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Manual entry">
    For small datasets or testing, add catalog types and entries directly in the [dashboard](https://app.incident.io/~/catalog).
    
    **Effort required:** Minimal, no technical expertise required
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="API integration">
    Build custom integrations using our [Catalog API](https://api-docs.incident.io/tag/Catalog-V2) for specific scenarios where you need direct API access.
    
    **Effort required:** Similar to catalog importer, requires technical resources
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Real-world example

Imagine you're managing incidents for a rail network. Your most common incident is signal failures that require dispatching engineers and notifying customers.

By modeling these catalog types:
- **Signal Failure Points** (with lookups to rail line, stations, component type)
- **Lines** (with lookups to status page, teams, stations)
- **Stations** (can be associated with multiple lines)
- **Teams** (with team leads, Slack channels, escalation policies)

You enable powerful automation: when someone selects the failing component during incident declaration, you can automatically:
- Dispatch the right engineering team
- Notify the line's customer service team
- Post status updates between the affected stations
- Bring in the appropriate communications lead

All from selecting a single field.
