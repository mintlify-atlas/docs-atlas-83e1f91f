---

The Catalog is your organization's connected map - how incident.io understands your services, teams, products, customers, and their relationships. It powers routing, automation, and reporting throughout the platform.

Think of the Catalog as interconnected spreadsheets or database tables. Each spreadsheet is a **Catalog Type** (like Services, Teams, or Products). Each row is an **Entry** (like your "payments-api" service or "platform" team). The columns are **Attributes** that describe entries and create connections between types.

## Why Catalog matters

The Catalog enables dynamic, context-aware automation that scales with your organization:

**Dynamic routing**
- Route alerts to the right team based on which service is affected
- Automatically page the current on-call engineer for a service without hardcoded names
- Escalate incidents to appropriate stakeholders based on customer or product context

**Incident enrichment**
- Automatically populate incident fields with relevant context from Catalog
- Surface team ownership, dependencies, and runbooks when incidents are created
- Link incidents to affected services and customers for better reporting

**Workflow automation**
- Use Catalog relationships in workflows to vary behavior by context
- Send notifications to different channels based on team or service ownership
- Create follow-up actions automatically for specific teams or incident types

**Reporting and insights**
- Aggregate incident metrics by service, team, or custom dimensions
- Track MTTR and incident volume across your service architecture
- Identify patterns and trends in your incident data

## Core concepts

### Catalog Types

A Catalog Type represents a category of things in your organization. Think of it as a spreadsheet or database table.

**Built-in types:**
- **Teams** - Groups of people who own services or respond to incidents
- **Services** - Applications, APIs, or infrastructure components
- **Users** - People in your organization

**Custom types:**
Create types for anything relevant to your organization:
- Products or features
- Customers or accounts
- Environments (production, staging)
- Regions or data centers
- Third-party dependencies

### Catalog Entries

An entry is a single item within a Catalog Type - like a row in a spreadsheet.

Examples:
- The "payments-api" service in your Services type
- The "Platform Engineering" team in your Teams type
- The "Enterprise Customer X" entry in your Customers type

Each entry has:
- A **name** that's human-readable and searchable
- A unique **ID** for referencing in automations
- **External IDs** for mapping to entries in other systems
- **Aliases** for alternate names or identifiers

### Catalog Attributes

Attributes are the columns in your Catalog Type - the properties that describe each entry and create relationships.

**Attribute types:**

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|----------|
| **Text** | Freeform strings | Service description, repository URL |
| **Number** | Numeric values | Priority score, SLA hours |
| **Boolean** | Yes/no values | Is production?, Requires compliance review? |
| **Single select** | One option from a list | Environment (Production, Staging, Dev) |
| **Multi select** | Multiple options from a list | Capabilities, supported regions |
| **Link to Catalog** | Reference to another entry | Owner team, depends on services |

**Relationship attributes** connect types together. For example:
- A Service has an "Owner" attribute linking to a Team
- A Team has an "Escalation Path" attribute for routing alerts
- A Customer has an "Account Manager" attribute linking to a User

These relationships power expressions and dynamic routing throughout incident.io.

## Getting data into Catalog

You can populate your Catalog through multiple channels:

### Import from integrations

Connect incident.io to your existing tools to automatically sync data:

- **Service catalogs** - Backstage, Cortex, OpsLevel
- **Alerting tools** - PagerDuty, Opsgenie (schedules, services, teams)
- **CRM systems** - Salesforce (accounts, customers)
- **ITSM tools** - ServiceNow (CMDB services, user groups)
- **Identity providers** - Okta, Google Workspace (users, teams)

Navigate to **Settings → Integrations** to connect these systems. Once configured, data syncs automatically and stays up to date.

### Manual entry through dashboard

Create and edit entries directly in the incident.io dashboard:

1. Go to **Catalog** in your dashboard
2. Select the type you want to add to
3. Click **Create entry**
4. Fill in attributes and relationships
5. Save the entry

This works well for:
- Initial setup when building your Catalog structure
- Small, infrequently-changing types
- One-off entries that don't exist in external systems

### API and Terraform

Use the incident.io API or Terraform provider for programmatic management:

**API** - Create, update, and delete entries via REST API. Useful for:
- Custom integrations with internal tools
- Automated sync from your own data sources
- Bulk imports from CSV or other formats

**Terraform** - Manage Catalog as infrastructure-as-code:
```hcl
resource "incidentio_catalog_entry" "payments_service" {
  catalog_type_id = data.incidentio_catalog_type.services.id
  name            = "payments-api"
  attribute_values = {
    owner       = incidentio_catalog_entry.platform_team.id
    description = "Handles payment processing"
    repo_url    = "https://github.com/myorg/payments-api"
  }
}
```

This approach enables:
- Version control for your Catalog structure
- Code review processes for changes
- Consistent, repeatable configuration

### Catalog importer tool

Use the open-source [catalog-importer](https://github.com/incident-io/catalog-importer) for advanced scenarios:

- Import from custom YAML or JSON files
- Pull data from Backstage catalog-info.yaml files
- Transform and map data from legacy systems
- Run scheduled syncs on your own infrastructure

## Keeping Catalog up to date

Your Catalog is most valuable when it reflects reality. Strategies for keeping it current:

**Prefer automated syncs**
Connect integrations to external systems and let them update automatically. When service ownership changes in GitHub, it updates in incident.io.

**Use external IDs**
Set external IDs for entries to map them to your systems of record. This ensures entries stay connected even if names change.

**Add aliases**
Create aliases for common variations in naming. If alerts refer to "payments", "payments-api", and "payment-service", add all as aliases to one entry.

**Audit regularly**
Set reminders to review Catalog data quarterly. Look for:
- Services without owners
- Deactivated users still assigned to roles
- Outdated descriptions or documentation links
- Missing relationships between entries

**Surface gaps through workflows**
Create workflows that flag missing Catalog data during incidents. For example, prompt users to set service owner if it's empty when an incident is created.

## Using Catalog in workflows and routing

The real power of Catalog emerges when you use it for automation:

### Dynamic alert routing

Instead of hardcoding alert routes for each service:

```
Alert → Service (from payload) → Owner Team (from Catalog) → Escalation Path
```

One alert route configuration works across all services. When team ownership changes in Catalog, routing updates automatically.

See [Alert routing](/product-documentation/on-call/alert-routing) for details.

### Workflow expressions

Use Catalog relationships in workflows to vary behavior:

- If **Affected Service** owner is **Platform Team** → page Platform on-call
- Else if **Affected Service** owner is **Product Team** → page Product on-call

Traverse relationships in expressions:
- `incident.service.owner.escalation_path` - Get the escalation path for the service's owner
- `alert.team.slack_channel` - Get the Slack channel for the alert's team

See [Workflow expressions](/product-documentation/workflows/workflow-expressions) for examples.

### Custom fields on incidents

Create custom fields that reference Catalog types:
- **Affected Service** - Link to Services type
- **Affected Customer** - Link to Customers type
- **Owning Team** - Link to Teams type

When these fields are set, you can use their attributes and relationships in automations. See [Custom fields](/product-documentation/catalog/custom-fields) for configuration.

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How is Catalog different from custom fields?">
    Custom fields are properties of incidents. Catalog is your organization's structure and relationships.

    Custom fields can *reference* Catalog (like "Affected Service"), but Catalog exists independently of incidents. It's the source of truth for your services, teams, and how they relate.

    Think of it this way: custom fields are "which service is affected by this incident?" Catalog is "what services exist, who owns them, and how do they connect?"
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I delete Catalog entries that are no longer relevant?">
    Yes, but check dependencies first. If workflows, alert routes, or incidents reference an entry, deleting it may break automations.

    incident.io will warn you if an entry is in use. Consider archiving instead - mark entries as inactive using a custom attribute rather than deleting.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens if I change a Catalog entry that's referenced in historical incidents?">
    Historical incidents retain their references to Catalog entries, but display current entry data. If you rename a service from "payments-api" to "payments-service", old incidents will show the new name.

    Entry relationships and attributes are point-in-time snapshots. Changing a service's owner today doesn't change who owned it during past incidents.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I model dependencies between services?">
    Create a "Depends on" attribute on your Services type that links to other Services (multi-select). Each service can then list its dependencies.

    Use this in workflows to:
    - Automatically notify dependent service owners when an incident affects an upstream service
    - Surface dependency context in incident channels
    - Report on blast radius of outages
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I restrict who can edit Catalog entries?">
    Yes. Configure permissions at **Settings → Roles**. You can control:
    - Who can create/edit/delete entries in specific types
    - Who can modify type definitions and attributes
    - Whether external syncs can overwrite manual edits

    This is useful for ensuring your service catalog stays accurate - only service owners can edit their services, for example.
