description: Create incident fields backed by Catalog to capture context and enable dynamic automation.
---

Custom fields let you capture information specific to your organization's incident response process. When you back custom fields with Catalog types, they become powerful tools for routing, automation, and reporting.

## Custom fields vs. built-in fields

incident.io provides standard fields on every incident:
- Name, summary, and severity
- Status and timestamps
- Incident lead and other roles
- Slack/Teams channel

Custom fields extend this with your organization's specific needs:
- **Affected Service** - Which service is experiencing issues
- **Affected Customer** - Which customers are impacted
- **Root Cause Category** - Classification for post-incident analysis
- **Estimated Revenue Impact** - Financial impact of the outage
- **Compliance Notification Required** - Whether regulatory reporting is needed

## Field types

Custom fields come in several types, each with different behaviors:

### Text fields

**Single line text** - Short text responses
- Use for: ticket IDs, short descriptions, URLs
- Example: "Support ticket number", "Monitoring dashboard link"

**Multi-line text** - Longer text responses  
- Use for: detailed explanations, runbook content
- Example: "Mitigation steps taken", "Customer communication plan"

### Numeric fields

**Number** - Numeric values with optional units
- Use for: counts, durations, impact metrics
- Example: "Users affected", "Estimated downtime (minutes)"

### Selection fields

**Single select** - Choose one option from a predefined list
- Use for: categories, classifications, yes/no decisions
- Example: "Root cause category" (Infrastructure, Code, Third-party, Human error)

**Multi select** - Choose multiple options from a list
- Use for: tags, capabilities, affected areas
- Example: "Affected products" (Web app, Mobile app, API, Admin portal)

### Link to Catalog

**Catalog-backed fields** reference entries in your Catalog types.

**Single Catalog entry** - Link to one entry
- Use for: affected service, owning team, incident commander
- Example: "Affected Service" linking to your Services catalog type

**Multiple Catalog entries** - Link to multiple entries
- Use for: affected services, impacted customers, notified teams
- Example: "Affected Customers" linking to your Customers catalog type

Catalog-backed fields unlock powerful automation:
- Access attributes and relationships in workflow expressions
- Route based on ownership or other Catalog properties
- Report and filter incidents by Catalog dimensions

## Creating custom fields

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to custom fields settings">
    Go to **Settings → Incidents → Custom fields**
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create a new field">
    Click **Create custom field** and choose a field type
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure the field">
    **Name** - Short, descriptive name (e.g., "Affected Service")
    
    **Description** - Help text that appears when users fill out the field
    
    **Field type** - Select the appropriate type for your data
    
    For Catalog-backed fields:
    - Choose **Link to Catalog**
    - Select which Catalog type this field references
    - Choose single or multiple entries
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Set field requirements">
    **Optional** - Can be left empty
    
    **Required** - Must be filled before incident can be created
    
    **Required before closing** - Must be filled before incident can be marked as closed
    
    Choose based on when you need the information. For example, "Affected Service" might be required at creation, while "Root Cause" is required before closing.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose where field appears">
    **Incident creation form** - Shown when creating new incidents
    
    **Incident details** - Editable in the incident sidebar throughout the incident lifecycle
    
    **Hidden** - Only accessible via API or workflows (useful for automation-only fields)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save the field">
    Click **Create** to add the field. It will immediately be available for new incidents.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Using Catalog-backed fields in automation

Catalog-backed fields enable dynamic behavior in workflows and routing:

### Access Catalog attributes

When a custom field references a Catalog entry, you can access that entry's attributes:

```
incident.custom_fields.affected_service.owner
```

This returns the Team that owns the affected service, letting you:
- Page the owning team's escalation path
- Send notifications to the team's Slack channel  
- Assign the incident lead from the team's members

### Traverse relationships

Catalog entries can reference other entries. Chain these relationships in expressions:

```
incident.custom_fields.affected_service.owner.escalation_path
```

This walks through:
1. Get the affected service from the incident
2. Find the team that owns that service
3. Get that team's escalation path
4. Use the escalation path to page the right people

### Example: Dynamic escalation workflow

Create a workflow that pages the correct team based on which service is affected:

**Trigger:** When incident is created

**Condition:** Affected Service is set

**Step:** Create escalation
- Escalation path: `incident.custom_fields.affected_service.owner.escalation_path`
- Message: `"Incident affecting {{incident.custom_fields.affected_service.name}}: {{incident.name}}"`

This single workflow handles all services. As ownership changes in your Catalog, escalations automatically route to the new owners.

### Example: Service-specific incident channels

Automate incident channel naming based on service:

**Trigger:** When incident is created

**Condition:** Affected Service is set

**Step:** Update incident
- Channel name: `"inc-{{incident.reference}}-{{incident.custom_fields.affected_service.name}}"`

Channels will be named like `inc-123-payments-api` or `inc-124-auth-service`.

### Example: Customer impact notifications

Send notifications to account managers when their customers are affected:

**Trigger:** When incident is created or changed

**Condition:** Affected Customers is set

**Step:** Create loop over Affected Customers
- For each customer:
  - Send direct message to `customer.account_manager`
  - Message: `"Incident {{incident.reference}} may be affecting {{customer.name}}"`

This requires your Customers catalog type to have an "Account Manager" attribute linking to users.

## Best practices

### Start with essential fields

Don't create fields "just in case." Each field adds cognitive load when creating incidents. Focus on fields that:
- Enable automation (like Affected Service for routing)
- Are required for compliance or reporting
- Significantly improve incident response or learning

You can always add more fields later.

### Use Catalog-backed fields for structured data

When information maps to a Catalog type, use a Catalog-backed field instead of text:

- ✅ "Affected Service" as Catalog field → enables automation
- ❌ "Affected Service" as text field → just documentation

- ✅ "Owning Team" as Catalog field → can route to team
- ❌ "Owning Team" as text field → can't automate with it

Text fields are fine for truly unstructured data like "Mitigation notes" or "Customer communication message."

### Make fields required thoughtfully

Required fields slow down incident creation. Only require fields when:
- You'll definitely need the information immediately
- Missing information would break critical automation
- Compliance or policy mandates capturing it

Use "Required before closing" for information gathered during incident response, like "Root Cause" or "Follow-up Actions Owner."

### Provide clear descriptions

Field descriptions appear as help text. Make them actionable:

- ✅ "Which service is experiencing degraded performance or errors?"
- ❌ "Service field"

- ✅ "Select all products where users are reporting issues"
- ❌ "Affected products"

Good descriptions reduce confusion during high-pressure incident response.

### Use multi-select sparingly

Multi-select fields are powerful but can complicate workflows:
- Looping over multiple values adds complexity
- Users may inconsistently select "all" vs. specific options
- Harder to filter and report on

Single-select fields are usually sufficient. Use multi-select when incidents genuinely affect multiple things simultaneously.

### Design for reporting

Think about how you'll use field data after incidents close:
- Use consistent categories in single-select fields
- Keep option lists manageable (5-10 options, not 50)
- Create fields for dimensions you want to filter by in dashboards

For example, a "Root Cause Category" field with 5-7 consistent options is more valuable for learning than a freeform "Root Cause" text field.

## Managing custom fields over time

### Editing existing fields

You can modify field definitions, but be aware of impacts:

**Safe changes:**
- Updating the description
- Changing visibility (hidden ↔ shown)
- Adding new options to select fields
- Adjusting requirement level (optional ↔ required)

**Changes requiring caution:**
- Removing options from select fields (incidents using those options will show an error)
- Changing field type (historical data may not convert cleanly)
- Renaming the field (workflows referencing it will break)

Test field changes on a test incident before rolling out widely.

### Deprecating fields

If a field is no longer needed:
1. Mark it as optional (if it was required)
2. Hide it from incident forms
3. Wait 30-90 days to ensure no workflows depend on it
4. Delete the field

incident.io will warn you if workflows or alert routes reference the field before deletion.

### Field visibility and permissions

Control who can edit custom fields:
- Configure at **Settings → Roles**
- Set permissions per field or for all fields
- Restrict sensitive fields (like "Estimated Revenue Impact") to specific roles

This is useful for ensuring data quality - only incident leads can set "Root Cause", for example.

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I have different custom fields for different incident types?">
    Not directly. Custom fields apply to all incidents.

    However, you can:
    - Use conditional visibility in workflows to only prompt for certain fields based on incident properties
    - Create a "Incident Type" field and document which fields apply to which types
    - Hide less-common fields from the creation form and add them later as needed
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens to historical incidents when I change a custom field?">
    Historical incidents retain their data, but changes to field definitions apply going forward:

    - If you remove an option from a select field, old incidents keep that value but it's marked as "deprecated"
    - If you rename a field, old incidents show the new name
    - If you delete a field, its data is archived but no longer visible in the UI

    Export incident data before making breaking changes if you need to preserve historical values.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can custom fields have default values?">
    Yes, for most field types:

    - Text fields can have default text
    - Numeric fields can default to a number
    - Select fields can default to a specific option
    - Catalog fields can default to a specific entry

    Configure defaults when creating or editing the field. Users can override defaults when creating incidents.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I use custom fields in API calls?">
    Custom fields are available via the incidents API:

    ```json
    {
      "custom_field_entries": [
        {
          "custom_field_id": "01H...",
          "values": [{"value_catalog_entry_id": "01H..."}]
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

    Get custom field IDs from the Custom Fields API endpoint. See the [API reference](/api-reference) for details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I use custom fields in Slack commands?">
    Yes. When creating incidents via `/inc create` in Slack, custom fields appear in the incident creation form.

    For Catalog-backed fields, Slack provides autocomplete search as you type. For select fields, you'll see a dropdown of options.
