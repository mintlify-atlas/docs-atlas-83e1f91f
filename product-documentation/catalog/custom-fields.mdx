title: Custom Fields with Catalog
description: Create dynamic custom fields that stay synchronized with your catalog data and automate field values using catalog relationships
---

## Overview

Custom fields powered by Catalog eliminate manual maintenance and enable intelligent automation. Instead of manually updating dropdown options or asking responders to fill in multiple fields, you can connect custom fields to catalog types and derive values automatically.

There are two powerful ways to use Catalog with custom fields:

1. **Populate field options from catalog** - Keep custom field options automatically synchronized with catalog data
2. **Automate field values** - Derive custom field values from other fields using catalog relationships

## Populating custom fields with catalog data

Fed up with manually maintaining options for custom fields? When you connect a custom field to a catalog type, any updates to that catalog type automatically reflect in the field options.

### Creating a catalog-backed custom field

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to custom fields">
    Go to Settings → Custom Fields in your dashboard
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Create or edit a field">
    Click "New custom field" or edit an existing one
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select catalog as the source">
    When configuring the field, select **"From a catalog type"** as the option for how the field should be managed
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Choose your catalog type">
    Select which catalog type should populate this field (e.g., Services, Teams, Customers)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save your field">
    The field will now stay synchronized with your catalog data automatically
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
**Example use case**

Create an "Affected Service" custom field backed by your Services catalog type. As your team adds or removes services in the catalog, the dropdown options in the incident form update automatically - no manual maintenance required.
</Info>

### Migrating existing custom fields

Already have custom fields with manually maintained options? You can migrate them to be managed from a catalog type.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the existing custom field">
    Navigate to the custom field you want to migrate
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Follow the migration wizard">
    incident.io will guide you through mapping existing options to catalog entries
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Complete the migration">
    Once migrated, the field will be kept in sync with the catalog going forward
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
The migration wizard helps you preserve historical data by mapping old options to new catalog entries.
</Note>

## Automatic custom fields

Automatic custom fields use catalog relationships to derive values from other custom fields - reducing mental overhead for responders and ensuring data consistency.

### Common use cases

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Speed up responders">
    When a responder selects an affected service, automatically populate the affected team without requiring another selection.
    
    **Example:** If the affected service is "Data Pipeline", the affected team is automatically set to "Data Engineering"
    
    This reduces the number of decisions responders need to make during high-stress incidents.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Improve reporting">
    Automatically derive higher-level categorizations for better insights and reporting.
    
    **Example:** If your organization has hundreds of teams, automatically set "Affected Division" or "Affected Function" based on the selected team.
    
    You can even hide this field from responders - it's purely for slicing and dicing data in reports.
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Enable smart workflows">
    Use derived fields in workflows to route incidents intelligently.
    
    **Example:** Automatically derive the "On-call Engineer" from the affected service's owning team, then use that in a PagerDuty escalation step.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### Creating an automated custom field

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start creating a custom field">
    Go to Settings → Custom Fields and click "New custom field"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Select 'Automated'">
    Choose **Automated** as the field type
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add an expression">
    Click "Add an expression" to open the Expression Builder
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Navigate through catalog relationships">
    Use the Expression Builder to navigate through your catalog structure:
    
    - Start with a field (e.g., "Affected Service")
    - Follow relationships to other catalog types (e.g., Service → Owning Team)
    - Select the final attribute you want to derive (e.g., Team → Team Lead)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure override settings">
    Decide whether users should be able to manually override the automated value:
    
    - **Allow overrides:** Good for "smart defaults" where users might need to adjust
    - **No overrides:** Perfect for reporting fields with consistent business logic
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Save the field">
    The field will now automatically populate based on your expression
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
**When to allow overrides**

- **Allow:** For fields like "Affected Team" where the derived value is usually correct but responders might need to adjust
- **Don't allow:** For fields like "Affected Division" that are purely for reporting and should follow consistent business rules
</Note>

## Expression examples

Here are common patterns for automatic custom fields:

<CodeGroup>
```text Team from Service
Affected Service → Owning Team
```

```text Manager from Team
Affected Team → Team Lead
```

```text Escalation Policy from Service
Affected Service → Owning Team → Escalation Policy
```

```text Division from Team
Affected Team → Division
```

```text Customer Success Manager from Customer
Affected Customer → CSM
```

```text Slack Channel from Team
Affected Team → Slack Channel
```
</CodeGroup>

## Multi-valued catalog fields

Some custom fields need to support multiple selections (e.g., multiple affected services). Catalog-backed fields fully support multi-select:

- **For catalog-backed fields:** Simply enable multi-select when creating the field
- **For automated fields:** The expression can return multiple values if the source field is multi-select

<Info>
**Example:** If "Affected Services" is multi-select and returns `[API, Dashboard]`, an automated "Affected Teams" field could return `[Backend Team, Frontend Team]` - one team per service.

## Best practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Start with core fields" icon="flag">
    Begin with the most common fields:
    - Affected Service → Affected Team
    - Affected Service → Escalation Policy
    - Affected Customer → Customer Success Manager
    
    These provide immediate value and help you learn the system.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Layer reporting fields" icon="chart-line">
    Once core fields are working, add hidden automated fields for reporting:
    - Team → Division
    - Team → Function
    - Service → Product Area
    
    These fields don't need to be shown to responders but enable powerful insights.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Test with realistic data" icon="vial">
    Create a test incident with various field combinations to ensure your automated fields work as expected before going live.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Document relationships" icon="book">
    Keep documentation of your catalog structure and automated field logic so team members understand what's being derived and why.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Regular catalog maintenance" icon="wrench">
    Ensure your catalog data stays up to date. Stale catalog data means incorrect automated field values.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Automated field is not populating" icon="circle-question">
    **Common causes:**
    - The source field hasn't been set yet
    - The catalog relationship doesn't exist for the selected value
    - The target attribute is empty in the catalog
    
    **Solution:** Check that the catalog entry has the required relationship and attribute populated.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Field options are outdated" icon="circle-question">
    **Cause:** Catalog data may not have synced yet
    
    **Solution:** 
    - Native integrations sync once per day
    - For immediate updates, manually edit the catalog or use catalog importer
    - Check [How to re-sync catalog data](/help-centre/catalog/how-to-re-sync-catalog-data)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Can't find catalog type in field options" icon="circle-question">
    **Cause:** The catalog type may not exist yet
    
    **Solution:** 
    - Navigate to Catalog in your dashboard
    - Create the catalog type first
    - Then return to create your custom field
  </Accordion>
